CORPORATIONS
* Corporation headquarters and executives removed, corporations spread on their own to cities that fulfill their requirements

STABILITY
* Stability checks are now triggered by certain events (e.g. discovering a technology, changing civics, losing/acquiring a city, starting wars, making peace)
* Stability scores are not permanent anymore, but instead calculated for every stability check (no permanent stability hits anymore)
* Only stability levels are stored: Collapsing, Unstable, Shaky, Stable, Solid
* Stability is divided into five categories:
	* Expansion: overexpansion (population outside vs. inside of core), recent expansion, recently razed cities
	* Economy: economic growth
	* Domestic: happiness, civic combinations, contemporary and outdated civics, religious unity
	* Foreign: vassal stability, defensive pacts, foreign relations
	* Military: war success, war weariness, barbarian losses
* After a check, the stability level can increase or decrease based on your stability score result
* If stability does not improve when on Collapsing, a complete collapse occurs
* Collapse after overextension triggers collapse to core instead of a complete collapse for AI civilisations

DIPLOMACY
* Congresses:
    * Triggered either periodically or when a large war ends
    * Players can claim cities or request to settle free spots
    * After a war, the winners can claim cities from the losers

    * When voting on a city claim, camera moves to the city in question
    * If an AI civ is undecided on your claim or a claim on one of your cities, you can attempt to influence them using gold or espionage
    * City assignments by the Congress can be refused, which might lead to war against the civilizations that voted yes
    * Voting AI takes its relationships, own interests and the legitimacy of a claim into account when voting on claims
    * Congresses establish contact between all participants
* General Apostolic Palace and United Nations rules:
    * Votes are now proportional to the square root of your (state religion) population, to give smaller civs more weight
    * When attempting to win a Diplomatic Victory, your own votes and those of your vassals do not count (you need to win a majority among the other civilizations)
    * Resolutions that affect all members do not fail if one member defies it, instead only defying civilizations are not affected
* Apostolic Palace:
    * Elections are initiated by building Saint Peter's Basilica
    * Only civilizations with Catholic state religion are members and allowed to vote
    * Renamed "Declare War" resolution to "Crusade": valid targets are non-member at war with members (defensive crusade) or non-members that control the Catholic shrine or holy city (offensive crusade)

    * Added "Send Inquisition" resolution: the Pope receives additional espionage against the target
