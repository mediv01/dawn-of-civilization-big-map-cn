		<English>[TAB]Assyria was an ancient empire of W Asia. It developed around the city of Ashur, or Assur, on the upper Tigris River and south of the later capital, Nineveh.[PARAGRAPH:1]The nucleus of a Semitic state was forming by the beginning of the 3d millennium B.C., but it was overshadowed by the greatness of Sumer and Akkad. Ashur was Assyria's chief god, but the gods of the Babylonians and Hittites were also honored. In the 17th cent. B.C., Assyria expanded briefly, but it soon relapsed into weakness. The 13th cent. B.C. saw Assyria threatening the surrounding states, and under Tiglathpileser I Assyrian soldiers entered the kingdom centered about Urartu, took Babylonia, and crossed N Syria to reach the Mediterranean. This empire was, however, only ephemeral.[PARAGRAPH:1]Assyrian greatness was to wait until the 9th cent., when Ashurnasirpal II came into power. He was not only a vigorous and barbarously cruel conqueror who pushed his conquests N to Urartu and W to Lebanon and the Mediterranean, but he was also a shrewd administrator. Instead of merely making conquered kings pay tribute, he installed Assyrian governors so that he could have more control over the empire.[PARAGRAPH:1]Shalmaneser III attempted to continue this policy, but, although he exacted heavy tribute from Jehu of Israel and claimed many victories, he failed to establish hegemony over the Hebrews and their Aramaic-speaking allies. The basalt obelisk, called the Black Obelisk (British Mus.), describes the expeditions and conquests of Shalmaneser III. Raids from Urartu were resumed and grew more destructive after the death of Shalmaneser. Calah, the capital of Assyria during the reigns of Ashurnasirpal II and Shalmaneser III, has been excavated.[PARAGRAPH:1]In the 8th cent. B.C. conquest was pursued by Tiglathpileser III. He subdued Babylonia, defeated the king of Urartu, attacked the Medes, and established control over Syria. As an ally of Ahaz of Judah (who became his vassal), he defeated his Aramaic-speaking enemies centering at Damascus. His successor, Shalmaneser V, besieged Samaria, the capital of Israel, in 722-721 B.C., but it was Sargon, his son, who completed the task of capturing Israel. Sargon's victory at Raphia (720 B.C.) and his invasions of Armenia, Arabia, and other lands made Assyria indisputably one of the greatest of ancient empires.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sargon's son Sennacherib devoted himself to retaining the gains his father had made. He is particularly remembered for his warfare against his rebellious vassal, Hezekiah of Judah. Sennacherib's successor, Esar-Haddon, defeated the Chaldaeans, who threatened Assyria and carried his conquests (673-670) to Egypt, where he deposed Taharka and established Necho in power. Under Assurbanipal, Assyria reached its zenith and approached its fall. When Assurbanipal was fighting against the Chaldaeans and Elamites, an Egyptian revolt under Psamtik I was successful.[PARAGRAPH:1]Assurbanipal's reign saw the Assyrian capital of Nineveh reach the height of its splendor. The library of cuneiform tablets he collected ultimately proved to be one of the most important historical sources of antiquity. The magnificent Assyrian bas-reliefs reached their peak. The royal court was luxurious. Assyrian culture owed much to earlier Babylonian civilization, and in religion Assyria seems to have taken much from its southern neighbor and subject.[PARAGRAPH:1]Despite the magnificence of Assurbanipal's court, Assyria began a rapid decline during his reign. The military aspect of the empire was its most prominent feature, for Assyria was prepared for conflict from beginning to end. Because of the ever-present need for men to fight the incessant battles, agriculture suffered, and ultimately the Assyrians had to import food. The division of society into a fairly rigid three-class system was not unlike that of other early western Asian peoples (e.g., Babylonia), but it did not supply a solid base for the overgrown Assyrian state.[PARAGRAPH:1]The lavish expenditures of Assurbanipal on warfare and building drained the resources of the empire and contributed to its weakness. The king of the Medes, Cyaxares, and the Babylonian ruler Nabopolassar, joined forces and took Nineveh in 612 B.C. Under the son of Nabopolassar, Nebuchadnezzar, Babylonia was renewed in power, and the great-grandson of Cyaxares, Cyrus the Great, was to establish the Persian Empire, which owed much to the earlier Assyrian state.[PARAGRAPH:1]</English>

		<Chinese>亚述是西亚的一个古老帝国。它在底格里斯河上游的阿舒尔（Ashur）市周围以及后来的首都尼尼微（Nineveh）以南发展起来。[PARAGRAPH:1]闪族国家的核心在公元前三世纪初形成，但它被苏美尔和阿卡德的伟大所掩盖。亚述是亚述的主要神，但巴比伦人和赫人的神也受到尊重。17美分。B、 在公元前50年，亚述短暂扩张，但很快又陷入了衰弱。13美分。B、 看到亚述威胁到周边国家，在提格拉特·皮莱瑟一世的领导下，亚述士兵进入了以乌拉尔图为中心的王国，占领了巴比伦尼亚，并穿越叙利亚北部到达地中海。然而，这个帝国只是昙花一现。亚述人的伟大是要等到9分。，当Ashurnasirpal II掌权时。他不仅是一个生气勃勃、野蛮残忍的征服者，他将自己的征服者从北到乌拉尔图、从西到黎巴嫩和地中海，而且还是一个精明的管理者。他不仅让被征服的国王进贡，还任命了亚述总督，以便对帝国拥有更多的控制权。沙尔曼·内塞尔三世试图继续这一政策，但尽管他向以色列耶胡人征收了大量贡品，并取得了许多胜利，但他未能对希伯来人及其亚拉姆语盟友建立霸权。玄武岩方尖碑，被称为黑色方尖碑（British Mus.），描述了Shalmaneser III的探险和征服。在Shalmaneser死后，从Urartu开始的袭击恢复并变得更具破坏性。卡拉赫是亚述在阿什尔·纳西尔帕尔二世（Ashurnasirpal II）和沙尔曼·埃塞尔三世（Shalmaneser III）统治时期的首都，现已发掘。[PARAGRAPH:1]第8分。B、 提格拉斯·皮莱瑟三世（Tiglathpileser III）进行了征服。他征服了巴比伦尼亚，打败了乌拉尔图国王，袭击了玛代人，并建立了对叙利亚的控制。作为犹大亚哈斯（后来成为他的附庸）的盟友，他打败了以大马士革为中心的讲亚拉姆语的敌人。他的继任者沙尔曼·埃塞尔五世（Shalmaneser V）于公元前722-721年包围了以色列首都撒玛利亚，但完成了占领以色列任务的是他的儿子萨尔贡（Sargon）。萨尔贡在拉斐亚的胜利（公元前720年）以及他对亚美尼亚、阿拉伯和其他国家的入侵，无疑使亚述成为古代最伟大的帝国之一。萨尔贡的儿子塞纳赫里布（Sennacherib）致力于保留他父亲所取得的成就。他因与叛逆的附庸犹大希西家作战而被人们铭记。塞纳基里布的继任者以撒·哈登击败了威胁亚述的迦勒底人，并将他的征服（673-670年）带到了埃及，在那里他废黜了塔哈卡，并建立了尼科政权。在阿舒巴尼帕尔的统治下，亚述达到了顶峰，并接近衰落。当阿舒巴尼帕尔与迦勒底人和以拦人作战时，普萨姆提克一世领导下的埃及起义取得了成功。亚述首都尼尼微在阿舒巴尼帕尔的统治下达到了辉煌的顶峰。他收集的楔形文字碑文图书馆最终被证明是古代最重要的历史来源之一。壮丽的亚述浅浮雕达到了顶峰。皇家宫廷很豪华。亚述文化在很大程度上归功于早期的巴比伦文明，在宗教上，亚述似乎从其南部邻国和臣民那里获得了很多东西。尽管阿舒巴尼帕尔（Assurbanipal）的宫廷非常宏伟，但亚述在其统治期间开始迅速衰落。帝国的军事方面是其最突出的特点，因为亚述自始至终都为冲突做好了准备。由于目前一直需要男子参加持续不断的战斗，农业受到影响，最终亚述人不得不进口粮食。将社会划分为相当严格的三级制度与其他早期西亚民族（如巴比伦尼亚）并无不同，但它并没有为繁衍的亚述国家提供坚实的基础。阿舒巴尼帕尔在战争和建筑上的奢侈开支耗尽了帝国的资源，助长了帝国的衰弱。公元前612年，米底斯国王、西亚克萨雷斯和巴比伦统治者纳波拉萨尔联手占领了尼尼微。在纳波拉萨尔的儿子尼布甲尼撒的领导下，巴比伦尼亚重新掌权，西亚克萨雷斯的曾孙赛勒斯大帝将建立波斯帝国，这在很大程度上归功于早期的亚述国家。[PARAGRAPH:1]</Chinese>

		<English>[H1]Ashurbanipal[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Assyria[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] c.685 - 627 BC[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]King Ashurbanipal was the ruler of ancient Assyria at the height of Assyrian military and cultural accomplishments and is considered to be the last great king of Assyria. He is known in Greek writings as Sardanapalus and as Asnappeer or Osnapper in the Bible.[PARAGRAPH:1]Through military conquests Ashurbanipal also expanded Assyrian territory and its number of vassal states. However, of far greater importance to posterity was Ashurbanipal's establishment of a great library in the city of Nineveh. The military and territorial gains made by this ruler barely outlived him but the Library he established has survived partially intact. A collection of 20,000 to 30,000 cuneiform tablets containing approximately 1,200 distinct texts remains for scholars to study today.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ashurbanipal's library was not the first library of its kind but it was one of the largest and one of the ones to survive to the present day. Most of it is now in the possession of the British Museum or the Iraq Department of Antiquities.[PARAGRAPH:1]</English>
