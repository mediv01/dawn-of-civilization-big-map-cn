		<English>About 2000 B.C. the Hittites appeared in northern Asia Minor, a region rich in iron. In 1650 B.C. the Hittites began building a powerful empire. They extended their control in Asia Minor, seized northern Syria from the Egyptians, and expanded into northern Mesopotamia, where they conquered the Babylonians. Hittite culture was greatly influenced by contacts with the Babylonians.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While they were less advanced than the peoples of Mesopotamia, they had learned to extract iron from ore - they were the first to make tools and weapons of iron. The Hittites heated iron ore and pounded out impurities before plunging it into cold water. The tools and weapons they made with iron were harder and had sharper edges than those made out of bronze or copper. Because iron was plentiful, the Hittites were able to arm more people at less expense.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Hittites tried to keep this valuable technology secret. But as their empire collapsed about 1200 B.C., Hittite ironsmiths migrated to serve customers elsewhere. The new knowledge thus spread across Asia, Africa, and Europe, ushering in the Iron Age.[PARAGRAPH:2]</English>

		<Chinese>大约在公元前2000年，赫梯人出现在小亚细亚北部，一个富含铁的地区。公元前1650年，赫梯人开始建立一个强大的帝国。他们扩大了对小亚细亚的控制，从埃及人手中夺取了叙利亚北部，并扩展到美索不达米亚北部，在那里他们征服了巴比伦人。赫梯人的文化在很大程度上受到了与巴比伦人接触的影响。虽然他们不如美索不达米亚的人民先进，但他们已经学会了从矿石中提取铁--他们是第一个用铁制造工具和武器的人。赫梯人将铁矿石加热并捣碎杂质，然后将其投入冷水中。他们用铁制造的工具和武器比用青铜或铜制造的工具和武器更坚硬，边缘更锋利。由于铁很丰富，赫梯人能够以较少的费用武装更多的人。[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]赫梯人试图对这项宝贵的技术保密。但随着他们的帝国在公元前1200年左右崩溃，赫梯人的铁匠们迁移到其他地方为顾客服务。新的知识因此在亚洲、非洲和欧洲传播开来，迎来了铁器时代。[PARAGRAPH:2]</Chinese>

		<English>[H1]Suppiluliuma I[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of the Hittites[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD] c. 1350 BC[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Suppiluliuma I (Shuppiluliuma) was king of the Hittites (ca. 1358 BC - 1323 BC). He achieved fame as a great warrior and statesman, successfully challenging the then-dominant Egyptian empire for control of the lands between the Mediterranean and the Euphrates.[PARAGRAPH:2]Suppiluliuma began his career as advisor and general to Tudhaliya III, then based at Samuha. In this capacity he defeated the Hittites' enemies among the Hayasa and the Kaskas. Both enemies then united around charismatic leaders to counter him; of these Karanni founded a semblance of a royal court in Hayasa, and Piyapili failed to do likewise for the Kaska. Suppiluliuma and Tudhaliya defeated these threats in turn, to the extent that the Hittite court could settle in Hattusa again.[PARAGRAPH:2]At some point, Suppiluliuma deposed and probably murdered his liege. Some of the priests later reported this to Suppiluliumas's son, successor, and biographer Mursili II, holding it as an outstanding crime of the whole dynasty.[PARAGRAPH:2]Suppiluliuma married a sister to the Hayasan king Hukkana, and his daughter Muwatti to Maskhuiluwa of the Arzawan state Mira. He retook Arzawan territory as far as Hapalla. His most permanent victory was against the Mitanni kingdom, which he reduced to a client state under his son-in-law Shattiwazza. He was also a master builder of large stone structures decorated with stone reliefs. It was during his reign that concepts of the sacred nature of royal leaders developed.[PARAGRAPH:2]Suppiluliuma then took advantage of the tumultuous reign of the Pharaoh Akhenaten, and seized control of Egyptian territory in Syria, inciting many Egyptian vassals to revolt.[PARAGRAPH:2]His success encouraged the widow of the Egyptian king Nibhuruyira (usually identified with Akhenaten or Tutankhamun) to write to him, asking him to send one of his sons to be her husband and rule Egypt, since she had no heir and did not wish to marry a commoner. Suppliluliuma dispatched an ambassador to Egypt to investigate; he reported that the situation was accurately described, and the king decided to take advantage of this windfall; unfortunately, Prince Zannanza died on the way, and the marriage alliance never was consummated.[PARAGRAPH:2]Suppililiuma was furious at this turn at events and unleashed his armies against Egypt's vassal states in Canaan and Northern Syria capturing much territory.[PARAGRAPH:2]Unfortunately, many of the Egyptian prisoners carried a plague which would eventually ravage the Hittite heartland and lead to the deaths of both of Suppiluliuma I and his successor, Arnuwanda II.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Annals of Suppiluliuma, compiled after his death by his son Mursili II, is an important primary source for the 14th century BC. One of Suppiluliuma's letters, addressed to Akenaten, was preserved in the Amarna letters (EA 41) archive at Akhetaten. It expresses his hope that the good relations which existed between Egypt and Hatti under Akhenaten's father would continue into Akhenaten's new reign.</English>

		<Chinese>[H1]苏皮卢利乌玛斯一世[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]赫梯国王[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]在位：约公元前1350年[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]背景：[PARAGRAPH:1]苏皮卢利乌玛斯一世（Shuppiluliuma）是赫梯人的国王（约公元前1358年-前1323年）。他以伟大的战士和政治家的身份成名，成功地挑战了当时占统治地位的埃及帝国对地中海和幼发拉底河之间土地的控制。在这个职位上，他打败了赫梯人的敌人哈亚萨人和卡斯卡斯人。这两个敌人后来都团结在有魅力的领导人周围来对付他；其中卡兰尼在哈亚沙建立了一个类似于王室的法庭，而皮亚皮利也没能为卡斯卡做同样的事。苏皮卢利乌玛斯一世和Tudhaliya依次击败了这些威胁，以至于赫梯宫廷可以再次在哈图萨定居。 [PARAGRAPH:2]在某个时候，苏皮卢利乌玛斯一世废黜了他的主子，并可能谋杀了他的主子。一些祭司后来向苏皮卢利乌玛斯一世的儿子、继任者和传记作者穆尔西里二世报告了此事，认为这是整个王朝的突出罪行。 [PARAGRAPH:2]苏皮卢利乌玛斯一世把妹妹嫁给了哈亚山国王Hukkana，把女儿Muwatti嫁给了阿尔扎万国Mira的Maskhuiluwa。他重新占领了Arzawan的领土，一直到Hapalla。他最持久的胜利是对米坦尼王国的胜利，他把米坦尼王国降为他女婿沙提瓦扎手下的一个客户国家。他也是一位建造大型石质结构的大师，用石质浮雕进行装饰。正是在他的统治期间，王室领袖的神圣性概念得到了发展。[PARAGRAPH:2]随后，苏皮卢利乌玛斯一世利用法老Akhenaten的动荡统治，控制了埃及在叙利亚的领土，煽动许多埃及附庸造反。 [PARAGRAPH:2]他的成功鼓励了埃及国王尼布鲁伊拉（通常被认为是阿肯那顿或图坦卡蒙）的寡妇写信给他，要求他派他的一个儿子做她的丈夫，统治埃及，因为她没有继承人，也不希望嫁给一个平民。苏皮卢利乌玛斯一世派遣了一位大使到埃及进行调查；他报告说，情况描述得很准确，国王决定利用这笔意外之财；不幸的是，Zannanza王子在途中死亡，婚姻联盟从未完成。 [PARAGRAPH:2]苏皮卢利乌玛斯一世对这一事件的转变感到愤怒，发动军队攻打埃及在迦南和北叙利亚的附庸国，占领了许多领土。 [PARAGRAPH:2]不幸的是，许多埃及俘虏携带了一种瘟疫，最终蹂躏了赫梯人的心脏地带，并导致苏皮卢利乌玛斯一世 I和他的继任者Arnuwanda II的死亡。苏皮卢利乌玛斯一世那顿父亲时期埃及和哈提之间存在的良好关系能够持续到阿肯那顿的新统治时期。</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]Hittites (Hebrew Hittim), were ancient people of Asia Minor and the Middle East, inhabiting the land of Hatti on the central plateau of what is now Anatolia, Turkey, and some areas of northern Syria. The Hittites, whose origin is unknown, spoke an Indo-European language. They invaded the region, which became known as Hatti, about 1900 bc and imposed their language, culture, and rule on the earlier inhabitants, a people speaking a non-Indo-European agglutinative language. The first town settled by the Hittites was Nesa, near present-day Kayseri, Turkey. Shortly after 1800 BC they conquered the town of Hattusas, near the site of present-day Bogazkale. Nothing more is known of Hittite history until, in the 17th century bc, the so-called Old Hittite Kingdom was founded by the Hittite leader Labarna (reigned about 1680-1650 bc), or Tabarna, and Hattusas became its capital. Labarna conquered nearly all of central Anatolia and extended his rule to the sea. His successors extended Hittite conquests into northern Syria. Mursili I (reigned about 1620-1590 bc), the second ruler after Labarna, conquered what is now ?alab (Aleppo), Syria, and raided Babylon about 1595 BC. Mursili?s assassination was followed by a period of internal strife and external weakness that ended during the reign of King Telipinu (reigned about 1525-1500 bc). To ensure the stability of the kingdom, he issued strict rules governing the royal succession. The law code may also have been compiled during his reign. Of Telipinu?s successors only the names are known.[PARAGRAPH:2]About 1450 BC the so-called New Hittite Kingdom was founded. One of its most important members, the royal prince Suppiluliuma (reigned about 1380-1346 bc), usurped the throne during a period of foreign invasions. After liberating his country and defeating his main enemy, the kingdom of Mitanni in northern Mesopotamia, he led his armies farther into Syria. There his conquests were made easier by a weakening of Egyptian power during the reign of the pharaoh Amenhotep IV, or Akhenaton. Thus the Hittite Kingdom under Suppiluliuma became a great empire rivaling the power of Egypt, Babylonia, and Assyria. After the death of Suppiluliuma, the Hittites were largely able to maintain their empire, although only by constant warfare. During the 15th and 14th centuries bc their holdings extended westward to the Aegean Sea, eastward into Armenia, southeastward into upper Mesopotamia, and southward into Syria as far as present-day Lebanon.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the last half of the 14th century bc, the Hittites continued to come into frequent conflict with Egypt. The two great powers struggled for control of Syria until a battle was fought in Kadesh, Syria, between the Hittite king Muwatalli (reigned about 1315-1296 bc) and the Egyptian pharaoh Ramses II. Although Ramses claimed a great victory, the Hittites continued to maintain their hold on Syria. The Hittite king Hattusili III (reigned about 1289-1265 bc) concluded a treaty of peace and alliance with Ramses years later and subsequently gave him his daughter in marriage. Thereafter, relations between the Hittites and Egyptians remained friendly until the Hittite Empire fell shortly after 1200 bc to invaders called the Sea Peoples in Egyptian records.[PARAGRAPH:2]The downfall of the empire was followed by confusion and conflict. Subsequently a number of Hittite city-states, the most famous of which was Carchemish, emerged in southeastern Anatolia and northern Syria. These states were peopled by an intermingled ethnic group, called Syro-Hittites, consisting primarily of the Hittites, of peoples from the former Hittite Empire, and the previous inhabitants of the two areas. The Syro-Hittite rulers used the Luwian language, in which hieroglyphics were employed for writing. Some of these city-states were conquered in the 10th century bc by the Aramaeans. Even after it was conquered, all of Syria was still called Hatti by the Assyrians. Both the city-states that were conquered by the Aramaeans and those that remained independent finally were made provinces of the Assyrian Empire under Sargon II about 715 bc.[PARAGRAPH:2]The primary sources of information about the Hittites came from Egyptian records, notably those of the 19th Dynasty, and from certain passages in the Bible. The earliest of these passages, calling the Hittites "Sons of Heth," possibly refers to the period of the Hittite Kingdom. Later passages allude to the Syro-Hittites.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1906 the royal archives of the Hittites themselves were discovered in excavations at Bogazkale. These discoveries cast doubt on many items of information gathered from Egyptian sources. For example, certain military engagements were mentioned as victories for the Hittites, whereas the Egyptian records identify the engagements as Hittite defeats. The importance of the discovery is that the archives made it possible to decipher the Hittite language, thus revealing information about previously unknown aspects of the culture, such as political organization, legislation, religion, and literature.[PARAGRAPH:2]Most of the texts found in the archives were written in the Hittite language, but treaties and state letters were written in Akkadian, the international language of the period. Other texts were written in the Hurrian language of southeastern Anatolia and northern Mesopotamia, a language unrelated to any known linguistic group. The Hittites used the cuneiform system of writing taken from the Babylonians, but they also employed a system of hieroglyphs to inscribe a language closely related to Hittite, possibly a Luwian dialect. Although the hieroglyphs were used during the period of the empire, most inscriptions belong to the period after its downfall. The literature of the Hittites was highly developed, particularly in the form of historical records and stories.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Hittite king acted as the supreme priest, military commander, and chief judge of the land. During the old kingdom he was assisted by the pankus, an advisory council of nobles, which later disappeared. The empire was administered by provincial governors acting as deputies of the king. Territories beyond the empire were frequently ruled as vassal kingdoms, and formal treaties were made with their rulers.[PARAGRAPH:2]The most outstanding achievements of the Hittite civilization lay in the fields of legislation and the administration of justice. The law codes of the Hittites reveal a strong Babylonian influence, but their administration of justice was far more lenient than that of the Babylonians. The Hittites rarely resorted to the death penalty or to bodily mutilation, both of which were characteristic of other civilizations of the ancient Middle East. Furthermore, Hittite justice rested in the main on the principle of restitution rather than on retribution or vengeance. The penalty for thievery, for example, was restoration of the stolen object and payment of some additional recompense; restitution in kind was gradually replaced by payment of money.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Hittite economy was basically agricultural. The principal crops were wheat and barley, and the chief animals were cattle and sheep. The Hittites also had mineral riches in the form of copper, lead, silver, and iron. Their metallurgical techniques were advanced for the time; they may have been the first people to work iron.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Hittites worshiped a variety of gods. A recurrent phrase in state documents is an invocation to the "thousand gods of Hatti", deities worshiped apparently throughout Asia Minor before and during the period of Hittite domination. Scholars have traced Sumerian, Babylonian, Assyrian, Hurrian, Luwian, and other foreign influences in the Hittite pantheon.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the rock sanctuary of Yazilikaya, near Bogazkale, is a remarkable series of reliefs cut into rock. The reliefs depict two long processions of gods and goddesses advancing toward each other. The majority of the gods remain unidentified, but the two deities heading the procession are the storm god, or weather god, and the sun goddess, the chief deities worshiped by the Hittites. Excavations at the sanctuary revealed a temple built in front of one chamber; the other, smaller chamber seems to have been devoted to the cult of a deceased king.[PARAGRAPH:2]Hittite mythology, like Hittite religion, represents a combination of elements that reflect the diversity of cults within the empire. Of special interest are certain epic poems containing myths, originally Hurrian with Babylonian motifs. These myths deal with several successive generations of gods who ruled the universe and with a monster who challenged the rule of the last king of the gods. They are similar to Greek myths contained in the Theogony by the Greek poet Hesiod and may have been their prototypes. How the myths might have reached Greece is not clear, but it is possible they were transmitted during the Mycenaean ascendancy in Greece (1400-1200 bc). Mycenaean Greeks are known to have been in western Anatolia then and to have traded with Hittite-held Syria. Hittite records refer to contacts between Hittite rulers and those of the kingdom of Ahhiyawa, which some scholars identify with the country of the Achaeans. Whether or not Hittite cultural elements were transmitted abroad, many of them survived in Anatolia until the first Roman penetration into Asia Minor in 190 bc. Such deities as the Great Mother and the storm god (called Jupiter Dolichenus by the Romans) were still worshiped at that time.[PARAGRAPH:2]The art and architecture of the Hittites reveal the influence of nearly all the contemporary cultures of the ancient Near East, and especially of Babylonia. Nevertheless, the Hittites achieved a certain independence of style that renders their art distinct. Their building materials were generally stone and brick, but they also used wooden columns. Their often massive palaces, temples, and fortifications frequently were adorned by stylized and intricate carved reliefs on walls, gates, and entrances.[PARAGRAPH:2]</English>
