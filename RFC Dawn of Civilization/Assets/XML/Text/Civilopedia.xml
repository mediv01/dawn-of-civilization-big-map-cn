		<English>[H1]George Washington[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]President of the United States of America[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1732 - 1799 AD[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]George Washington was born into wealth and gentility (or what passed for it in early American history). His family owned a lot of land in Virginia, and Washington grew up as a gentleman farmer. Early on he displayed a taste for adventure, and when the French and Indian war broke out, Washington was commissioned a Lieutenant Colonel at the age of 22. His British superiors praised him for his gallantry and courage under fire.[PARAGRAPH:2]As he matured, Washington grew to dislike the protectionist policies of the British government, and he was elected one of the Virginia delegates to the Continental Congress. Being one of the few men with actual military service, when war was imminent, he was appointed Commander in Chief of the (largely theoretical) Continental Army.[PARAGRAPH:2]As a war leader, Washington faced enormous challenges. Lacking money, equipment and trained troops and hampered by the new country's inherent political problems, he had to organize, equip and recruit an army that could stand up to the finest military in the world. In his first engagement, shortly after the "battle" of Bunker Hill, his forces drove the unprepared British out of Boston. But when he next met the foe on Long Island, New York, he was totally outnumbered, outgunned, and out-generaled by the British, and he was lucky to escape the total destruction of his army.[PARAGRAPH:2]After this humiliating defeat, Washington began to employ the tactics that would eventually win the war. He realized that time was his best ally - the longer the war continued, the greater the British war weariness would grow. He couldn't hope to defeat the British war machine - but he could hope that the British would eventually give up the fight as not worth the cost. Further, the longer the war went on, the greater the chance that a foreign government would intervene on the American side.[PARAGRAPH:2]For the next six weary years Washington fought to keep his army intact. He avoided major engagements. He harried the British troops when they were vulnerable, and retreated into the mountains when they were powerful. His forces dwindled to virtually nothing in the winter, and swelled with temporary volunteers during the summer. Men went shoeless and hungry, and morale plummeted. Only Washington's iron will and strong personal magnetism kept the army alive.[PARAGRAPH:2]Finally, in 1781, the long-awaited foreign intervention occurred, and France went to war with Britain. With their invaluable naval assistance, Washington was able to capture the main British army in Yorktown, forcing Great Britain to admit defeat.[PARAGRAPH:2]Washington became the first President of the United States. Prone to pomposity, he was an "Imperial" president, giving the new office much of the stature and dignity it has maintained ever since, while strongly reinforcing its democratic underpinnings. He believed in neutrality in foreign affairs - at least until the new country was stronger - and he sought to keep the twin evils of regionalism and factionalism from infecting the federal government. In this he was largely unsuccessful, as the next several centuries would attest.[PARAGRAPH:2]Washington retired at the end of his second term. He returned to his family home and once again took up the life of a gentleman farmer. He died three months later, beloved by his countrymen and rightly recognized as the "father of his country."</English>

		<Chinese>[H1]乔治·华盛顿[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]美国总统[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]生卒年份：[\BOLD]1732-1799年[PARAGRAPH:2:1][BOLD]背景:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]乔治·华盛顿出生于富裕而有教养的家庭（根据美国早期历史著作的说法）。他的家族拥有弗吉尼亚的大片土地，于是华盛顿成长为一名农场主。早年的他即显示出对冒险的渴望，当对法国人与印第安人的战争爆发时，22岁的华盛顿被任命为中校。他的英国上司赞扬了他在炮火下表现出的英勇精神。[PARAGRAPH:1]年龄渐长，华盛顿开始对英国政府的贸易保护政策不满，而他作为弗吉尼亚的代表之一参加了大陆会议。当战争来临时，作为少数具有实战经历的议员，他被任命为（理论上的）大陆军总司令。[PARAGRAPH:1]作为战争领袖，华盛顿面临着巨大的挑战。缺少金钱、缺少装备、缺少训练有素的士兵，加上来自新成立国家的各种政治问题的羁绊，他必须迅速招募组织和装备一支能与世界最强战争机器对抗的军队。起初大陆军在邦克山“战役”中旗开得胜，并将缺乏防备的英军赶出了波士顿。但是当第二次在纽约长岛遭遇敌军时，他被不仅在数量上，也在武器上优于自身的英军以优越的战术打得一败涂地，但毕竟是他使得部队侥幸地避免了全军覆没的危险。[PARAGRAPH:1]自从这次羞辱性的惨败后，华盛顿开始制定了一个籍以最终获胜的战略。他意识到时间是他的最好盟友——战争拖延得越久，英国内部的厌战情绪就越强。他不寄希望于打败强大的英国战争机器——但他可以期待对方终因难以承受代价而放弃这场战争。进一步讲，战争越久，外国政府就越有可能进行干预，支持北美人民的斗争。[PARAGRAPH:1]在长达六年的战争中，华盛顿努力使军队保持完整。他避免正面作战。他在英军疲惫的时候对其进行骚扰，在他们强大的时候退却到山区。冬天的时候他将军队减员到最低限度，而在夏天靠志愿者的帮助极力扩充。士兵们因没有饭吃，没有鞋穿而士气低落。然而华盛顿钢铁般的意志与强大人格魅力保证了大陆军的生存。[PARAGRAPH:1]最终，1781年，期待已久的外国干预发生了，法国向英国宣战。靠着强大的法国海军协助，华盛顿得以在约克镇逼降了英军主力，迫使大英帝国承认战败。[PARAGRAPH:1]此后华盛顿当选为美利坚合众国第一位总统。可以毫不夸张地说，他是一位“帝皇级”的总统，他给予这个新生国家的民主基础以极大的助力，使其达到前所未有的高度。在外交方面他崇尚中庸主义——至少在美国更加强盛之前——而他致力于寻求如何避免让地方主义与党派之争这两个毒瘤感染联邦政府。但后来几世纪的历史表明，在这一点上他做得并不成功。[PARAGRAPH:1]华盛顿在他第二任总统任期结束后退休。他回到家乡重拾乡绅生活。三个月后去世，他被爱戴他的同胞们尊称为“国父”。</Chinese>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_CIV_MAMLUKS_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]A mamluk was a slave soldier who converted to Islam and served the Muslim caliphs and the Ayyubid sultans during the Middle Ages. Over time, they became a powerful military caste often defeating the Crusaders. On more than one occasion, they seized power for themselves; for example, ruling Egypt in the Mamluk Sultanate from 1250-1517.[PARAGRAPH:1]The first mamluks served the Abbasid caliphs at the end of the 9th century Baghdad. The Mamluk system was an evolution of a previous system, the Ghulam system, invented by the Caliph al-Mu'tasim, in which Turkish prisoners of war became the caliphal guard. This system ended in disaster in the 860s with the murder of four caliphs in a row, and the Mamluk system was created on its ruins. The main difference was that the Mamluks were captured as children and then trained and moulded within the Islamic world to ensure their loyalty to their masters. The Abbasids "recruited" them mainly from areas near the Caucasus (mainly Circassian and Georgian) in later periods, and in the 13th-14th centuries from areas north of the Black Sea (mainly Turkic, most of whom were Kipchak Turks), as well as boys from East Slav populations. Those captured were of non-Muslim origin.[PARAGRAPH:1]After mamluks had converted to Islam, many were trained as cavalry soldiers. Mamluks had to follow the dictates of furusiyya, a code that included values such as courage and generosity, and also cavalry tactics, horsemanship, archery and treatment of wounds, etc.[PARAGRAPH:1]Mamluks lived within their garrisons and mainly spent their time with each other. Their entertainments included sporting events such as archery competitions and presentations of mounted combat skills at least twice a week. The intensive and rigorous training of each new recruit helped ensure continuity of mamluk practices.[PARAGRAPH:1]In June 1249, the Seventh Crusade under Louis IX of France landed in Egypt and took Damietta. The Egyptian troops retreated at first. When the Egyptian sultan As-Salih Ayyub died, the power passed briefly to his son Turanshah and then his favorite wife Shajar Al-Durr. She took control with mamluk support and launched a counterattack. Troops of the Bahri commander Baibars defeated Louis's troops. The king delayed his retreat too long and was captured by the Mamluks in March 1250, and agreed to a ransom of 400,000 livres. Political pressure for a male leader made Shajar marry the mamluk commander Aybak; he was later killed in his bath, and in the power struggle that ensued vice-regent Qutuz took over. He formally founded the first Mamluk sultanate and the Bahri dynasty.[PARAGRAPH:1]When the Mongol troops of Hulagu Khan sacked Baghdad in 1258 and advanced towards Syria, Mamluk Emir Baibars left Damascus to Cairo where he was welcomed by Sultan Qutuz. After taking Damascus, Hulagu demanded that Qutuz surrender Egypt but Qutuz had Hulegu's envoys killed and, with Baibars' help, mobilized his troops. Although Hulegu had to leave for the East when great Khan M枚ngke died in action against the Southern Song, he left his lieutenant, the Christian Kitbuqa, in charge. Qutuz drew the Mongol army into an ambush near the Orontes River, routed them at the Battle of Ain Jalut and captured and executed Kitbuqa.[PARAGRAPH:1]After this great triumph, Qutuz was assassinated by conspiring Mamluks. It was said that Baibars, who seized power, was involved in the assassination. In the following centuries power was often transferred this way: the average reign of a mamluk ruler was seven years.[PARAGRAPH:1]The mamluks defeated the Mongols a second time in Homs in 1260 and began to drive them back east. In the process they consolidated their power over Syria, fortified the area, formed mail routes, and formed diplomatic connections between the local princes. Baibars's troops attacked Acre in 1263, captured Caesaria in 1265, and massacred the inhabitants of Antioch in 1268.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Mamluk Sultanate survived until 1517, when it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire. The institution of the mamluks continued under the Ottomans, although not in the same form as under the Sultanate.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_UNIT_FRENCH_GENDARME_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]A gendarme was a heavy cavalryman of noble birth, primarily serving in the French army from the Late Medieval to the Early Modern periods of European history. Their heyday was in the late fifteenth to mid sixteenth centuries, when they provided the Kings of France with a potent regular force of heavily armoured, lance-armed cavalry which, when properly employed, could dominate the battlefield.[PARAGRAPH:2]		[PARAGRAPH:2]		Like most fifteenth century sovereigns, the Kings of France sought to possess standing armies of professionals to fight their incessant wars, most notable of which was the Hundred Years War. By that period, the old form of feudal levy had long proven inadequate and had been replaced by various ad hoc methods of paying vassal troops serving for money rather than simply out of feudal obligation, a method that was heavily supplemented by hiring large numbers of out-and-out mercenaries.[PARAGRAPH:2]These methods, though improvements on the old annual 40-day service owed by knights (the traditional warrior elites of Medieval Europe), were also subject to strain over long campaigns. During periods of peace they also resulted in social destabilization, as the mercenary companies-referred to in this period as routiers- refused to disband until granted their back-pay (which was invariably hopelessly in arrears), and generally looted and terrorized the areas they occupied.[PARAGRAPH:2]The French kings sought a solution to these problems by issuing ordinances (ordonnances) which established standing armies in which units were permanently embodied, based, and organized into formations of set size. Men in these units signed a contract which kept them in the service of the unit for periods of one year or longer. The first such French ordinance was issued by King Charles VII at the general parliament of Orl&#233;ans in 1439, and was meant to raise a body of troops to crush the devastating incursions of the Armagnacs.[PARAGRAPH:2]Eventually more ordinances would set the general guidelines for the organization of companies of gendarmes, the troops in which were accordingly called the gendarmes d'ordonnance. Each of the 15 gendarme companies was to be of 100 lances fournies, each composed of six mounted men-a noble heavy armoured horseman, a more lightly armed fellow combatant (coutillier), a page (a non-combatant) and three mounted archers meant as infantry support. The archers were intended to ride to battle and dismount to shoot with their bows, and did so until late in the fifteenth century, when they took to fighting on horseback as a sort of lighter variety of gendarme, though still called "Archers." These later archers had armour less heavy than the gendarmes, and a light lance, but could deliver a capable charge when necessary.[PARAGRAPH:2]This organization was provisional, however, and one of the mounted archers was commonly replaced by another non-combatant, a servant (valet).[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1434, the pay for the members of the company was set as 120 livres for gendarmes, 60 for coutilliers, 48 for archers, and 36 for the non-combatants.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gendarme unit organization evolved over time. The retention of the lance as a relevant small unit formation, a relic of medieval times, gradually fell away in the sixteenth century, and, by an edict of 1534, Francis I declared that a company of gendarmes would be made up of 40 gendarme heavy, and sixty archer medium, cavalry (each gendarme having two unarmed attendants, pages and/or valets), thus practically ending the old proportions of troop types based on the number of lances. By the 1550s, advances in firearm technology dictated that a body of 50 light cavalry armed with an arquebus be attached to each gendarme company.[PARAGRAPH:2]The heavy cavalrymen in these companies were almost invariably men of gentle birth, who would have served as knights in earlier feudal forces. In many ways they still closely resembled knights-wearing a complete suit of plate armour, they fought on horseback, charging with the heavy lance.[PARAGRAPH:2]A gendarme company was formed by the crown, the king appointing a magnate to raise the company and be its captain, and paying him for its maintenance. In this way, the bonds between the crown and the magnates were maintained, as the king's patronage essentially bought the loyalty of the nobility. Likewise, appointment of individual gentlemen to a gendarme company (a matter of provincial administration) was mostly accomplished by patronage and recommendation, favouring those with the right family connections. Recruits preferred positions in companies stationed in their home province, but did not always obtain them.[PARAGRAPH:2]The total number of gendarmes in the companies varied over the decades. The high point was roughly 4,000 lances during the latter part of the reign of Louis XI, but the Estates General of 1484 reduced this to 2,200 lances, which number was thereafter, more or less, the peacetime average. This was generally increased by another 1,000 lances in wartime. When conflict ended, the reduction came either in the number of companies, or in the number of lances in the companies (or by a combination of these two methods). Captains dreaded a reduction of their company as a diminution of their prestige and income, and worked hard to prevent this-which companies were reduced usually reflected the influence of the respective captains at court.[PARAGRAPH:2]The gendarme companies were permanently stationed in towns in the provinces throughout France, subject to be summoned during wartime and concentrated in the Royal armies. Some became closely associated with the towns where they were stationed. If these garrison towns did not have sufficient resources to support the gendarmes present, as was often the case, individuals often found lodging in nearby areas. This lack of lodging could apply even in times of peace, when many of the men retired to their homes instead of remaining in the garrison (particularly in winter), and despite the contemporary system of giving leave, which allowed up to one quarter of the company to be away at any given time. Men who were away for these reasons were to be brought back to the company by the captains when ordered to do so by the provincial governor. Long-term absence was a chronic problem in the companies.</English>

		<Chinese>[TAB]宪兵是一位重度贵族的骑兵，主要在中世纪后期至欧洲历史早期的法国军队中服役。他们的鼎盛时期是15世纪到16世纪中叶，当时他们向法国国王提供了一支强大的正规部队，装备有重装盔甲的长枪骑兵，如果正确使用它们，它们可以在战场上占主导地位。[PARAGRAPH：2] [PARAGRAPH ：2]与大多数15世纪的君主一样，法国国王寻求拥有专业的常备军来对抗不断的战争，其中最著名的是百年战争。到那个时期，长期以来，封建征的旧形式已被证明是不适当的，并已由各种专门的为付钱来偿付附庸部队的临时方法所取代，而不是仅仅出于封建义务，而大量租用的方法是对这种方法的补充。 [PARAGRAPH：2]尽管对骑士（中世纪欧洲的传统武士精英）所欠的每年40天的旧服进行了改进，但这些方法也因长期战役而受到压力。在和平时期，它们还导致社会动荡，因为在此期间，雇佣军公司称卢布族为贱民，他们拒绝解散，直到得到他们的欠薪（这总是无可避免地拖欠了欠款），并且普遍掠夺和恐吓了他们所在的地区[PARAGRAPH：2]法国国王通过发布法令（监狱）寻求解决这些问题的方法，该法令建立了常设部队，在这些常设部队中，部队被永久体现，立足并组织成固定规模的编队。这些单位的人签署了一份合同，使他们在单位中任职一年或更长时间。第一项这样的法国法令是1439年由查理七世国王在奥尔良议会通过的，目的是筹集一支部队来压制对阿玛格纳克人的破坏性入侵。[PARAGRAPH：2]最终，更多法令将使总督宪兵连队的组织准则，其中的部队也因此被称为“宪兵宪兵”。 15个宪兵连中的每一个都由100名长枪四人组成，每人由6名骑兵组成-贵族级重型装甲骑兵，一名轻装武装的战斗员（同盟国），一页（一名非战斗员）和三名骑兵弓箭手作为步兵的支援。弓箭手原本打算骑兵战斗并下弓射击，直到15世纪末他们才骑着马骑，作为一种较轻的宪兵，尽管仍被称为“弓箭手”。这些后来的弓箭手的盔甲不如宪兵轻，但能轻装突击，但可在需要时提供强大的冲锋。[PARAGRAPH：2]该组织是临时的，而且其中一个骑兵弓箭手通常被另一个非弓箭手代替[PARAGRAPH：2]在1434年，将公司成员的工资定为宪兵120里弗，宪兵60，弓箭手48，非战斗员36。[PARAGRAPH ：2]宪兵单位组织随着时间的推移而发展。保留长矛作为相关的小型编队，是中世纪的遗迹，在16世纪逐渐消失。根据1534年的I令，弗朗西斯一世宣布，宪兵连将由40个重的宪兵组成和60名弓箭手骑兵（每个宪兵都有两名手无寸铁的服务员，骑兵和/或侍应员），因此实际上根据长枪的数量结束了部队的旧比例。到1550年代，枪支技术的进步迫使每个宪兵连附有50辆轻型骑兵，装备轻型步枪。[PARAGRAPH：2]这些公司中的重骑兵几乎总是轻度出生的人，他们会在早期的封建势力中担任骑士。在许多方面，他们仍然非常类似于骑士，穿着一套完整的板甲盔甲，他们在马背上作战，挥舞着沉重的长枪。[PARAGRAPH：2]王冠组建了宪兵连，国王任命了一个大亨来举起贵族。公司并担任其队长，并支付维护费用。这样，国王和王室之间的纽带得以维持，因为国王的光顾实质上是对贵族的忠诚。同样，任命绅士到宪兵公司（由省政府管理）主要是通过光顾和推荐来实现的，这有利于那些拥有正确家庭关系的人。新兵在本国驻扎的公司中优先考虑职位，但并非总是能获得。[PARAGRAPH：2]几十年来，公司的宪兵总数各不相同。在路易十一统治后期，最高点大约为4,000支长矛，但1484年的国民议会将其减少为2,200支长矛，此后的人数或多或少是和平时期的平均水平。通常在战时又增加了1000支长枪。冲突结束后，减少的数目要么是公司数量，要么是公司中长矛数量的减少（或通过这两种方法的组合）。船长们害怕削减自己的公司，因为信誉和收入减少了，并竭力防止这种情况的减少，因为公司减少通常反映了各自船长在法庭上的影响。[PARAGRAPH：2]宪兵公司永久驻扎在法国各省的城镇，在战争期间会被召唤并集中在皇家军队中。一些与他们驻扎的城镇紧密相关。如果这些驻军城镇没有足够的资源来支持宪兵（通常如此），那么人们通常会在附近地区找到住所。即使在和平时期，即使许多人退休而不是留在驻军中（特别是在冬天），但尽管有现代的休假制度，这种住房不足的情况也可能适用，尽管这种制度允许最多四分之一的人休假。公司在任何给定时间不在。由于这些原因而离开的人员应由省长命令将其带回公司。长期缺勤是公司中的长期问题。</Chinese>

		<English>[H1]Mehmed II the Conqueror[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Sultan of the Ottoman Empire[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1432 - 1481 AD[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Mehmed II, also known as el-Fatih ("the Conqueror") was the sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1451 - 1481 AD. He is best known for capturing the city of Constantinople, turning it into the new Ottoman capital and destroying the Byzantine Empire in the process. Mehmed was born in Edirne, which was then the capital of the Ottoman state, in 1432. He was fascinated by military matters from an early age; by the time that he reached maturity and ascended to the position of sultan (in 1451), Mehmed was prepared to begin the attack upon the city of Constantinople.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the thousand-year history of the Byzantine Empire, Constantinople had withstood sieges many times. It had only been captured once, by the Fourth Crusaders in 1204. But by the fifteenth century the Byzantine Empire was a battered shell of its former self: while it still held Constantinople, it retained only a few small territories outside the cities walls (mainly in Greece).[PARAGRAPH:2]Mehmed began the siege by constructing a pair of fortresses on both sides of the straights surrounding the city, thus preventing reinforcement by sea. When Mehmed attacked in 1453, the Byzantines were horribly outnumbered: there were only 7000 defenders to meet an army of roughly 100,000 Turks. Help was not forthcoming from the West, which remained hostile to the Byzantines because of the split between the Catholic and Orthodox churches.[PARAGRAPH:2]Using enormous primitive cannon, the Ottomans battered the walls of Constantinople for weeks (although the rate of fire was so slow that the defenders were able to repair much of the damage as it took place). On May 29 Mehmed finally ordered an assault at a damaged section of the walls. The assault was successful, and the attackers succeeded in breaking into the city streets. The cities fate was sealed. The last Emperor, Constantine XI, died in battle, and the ancient empire was extinguished forever.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mehmed gave his soldiers a day to loot the city (which was a customary practice at the time), during which a large portion of the populace was slaughtered, raped, or enslaved. After his soldiers' greed and lust were sated, Mehmed made every effort to rebuild the city and repopulate it with Turks. (Despite this odious "ethnic cleansing" at the beginning of his reign, Mehmed generally treated his non-Islamic subjects well, granting them permission to practice their religion freely, as well as a great deal of local autonomy.) The Byzantine administration was largely preserved intact and was given the task of running the Ottoman Empire.[PARAGRAPH:2]Upon consolidating his control over Constantinople, Mehmed finished off the last remnants of the Byzantine Empire by conquering some small states in Greece and in 1461 he conquered the tiny Empire of Trebizond on the Black Sea. He then tried to extend his empire into Europe, but in 1462 he was defeated by Prince Vlad III (the real Count Dracula) of Wallachia, and at the Battle of Vaslui in 1475 he suffered a major loss to the Moldavian Prince Stefan. These defeats put an end to that campaign. However, Mehmed still had ambition - and plenty of it.[PARAGRAPH:2]Believing that his conquest of Rome made him the legitimate ruler of the late Roman Empire, at the end of his life Mehmed embarked on an ambitious but foolhardy campaign to reunite his divided empire. The campaign began well; the Ottomans invaded Italy, and in 1840 the city of Otranto was easily captured. However, a rebellion in Albania the same year threatened the Ottoman supply lines, forcing the Ottomans to divide their forces. The following year a large Christian army led by the pope pushed the Ottomans from Italy. Mehmed died in 1481, putting an end forever to his dream of recapturing the ancient glory of Rome.[PARAGRAPH:2]In large, history has judged Mehmed kindly. He is recognized for his military success and his strong rule, and later Ottoman sultans would seek to follow his example. Mehmed's conquest of Constantinople was one of the most important events in Western history, signifying the end of the medieval period. His attack upon Italy may have been foolish, but it ultimately did little to harm the young Ottoman Empire that was his legacy.</English>

The origins of the temple date back to 478 BC, when a local ruler built a temple to honor Confucius (who had only recently passed away and was relatively unknown in most of China). As time passed and the fame of Confucius began to spread, the Kong Miao grew in stature and importance as well. The Han Emperor Wu Di offered sacrifices at the site in 205 BC, and the Kong Miao continued to be patronized by various emperors across the centuries.[PARAGRAPH:1]The actual buildings that make up the San Kong have been torn down and rebuilt many times over the centuries. The present layout of the Kong Miao dates to the early 16th century, when the temple was rebuilt following a massive conflaguration in 1499 sparked by lightning. Since this construction took place at the same time as Beijing's Forbidden Palace, there are many design similarities between the two complexes. The Kong Miao is known not only for its size (it comprises some 466 rooms), but also for its stone sculptures and calligraphy dating back to many different dynasties. Today it is both a holy Confucian shrine and a popular tourist attraction.</English>

Spacecraft carrying people may be operated directly, by human crew, or it may be either remotely operated from ground stations on Earth or be autonomous, able to carry out a specific mission with no human involvement.[PARAGRAPH:2]The first human spaceflight was launched by the Soviet Union on 12 April 1961 as a part of the Vostok program, with cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin aboard. Humans have been continuously present in space for 18 years and 200 days on the International Space Station. All human spaceflight has so far been human-piloted, with the first autonomous human-carrying spacecraft under design starting in 2015.[PARAGRAPH:2]Russia and China have human spaceflight capability with the Soyuz program and Shenzhou program. In the United States, SpaceShipTwo reached the edge of space in 2018; this was the first crewed spaceflight from the USA since the Space Shuttle retired in 2011. Currently, all expeditions to the International Space Station use Soyuz vehicles, which remain attached to the station to allow quick return if needed. The United States is developing commercial crew transportation to facilitate domestic access to ISS and low Earth orbit, as well as the Orion vehicle for beyond-low-Earth-orbit applications.[PARAGRAPH:2]While spaceflight has typically been a government-directed activity, commercial spaceflight has gradually been taking on a greater role. The first private human spaceflight took place on 21 June 2004, when SpaceShipOne conducted a suborbital flight, and a number of non-governmental companies have been working to develop a space tourism industry. NASA has also played a role to stimulate private spaceflight through programs such as Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) and Commercial Crew Development (CCDev). With its 2011 budget proposals released in 2010, the Obama administration moved towards a model where commercial companies would supply NASA with transportation services of both people and cargo transport to low Earth orbit. The vehicles used for these services could then serve both NASA and potential commercial customers. Commercial resupply of ISS began two years after the retirement of the Shuttle, and commercial crew launches could begin by 2019.</English>

Georgius Agricola, in De re metallica, reported a traditional serendipitous "discovery" tale of familiar type:[PARAGRAPH:1]"The tradition is that a merchant ship laden with nitrum being moored at this place, the merchants were preparing their meal on the beach, and not having stones to prop up their pots, they used lumps of nitrum from the ship, which fused and mixed with the sands of the shore, and there flowed streams of a new translucent liquid, and thus was the origin of glass."[PARAGRAPH:1]This account is more a reflection of Roman experience of glass production, however, as white silica sand from this area was used in the production of glass within the Roman Empire due to its low impurity levels.[PARAGRAPH:1]During the 1st century BC glass blowing was discovered on the Syro-Palestinian coast, revolutionizing the industry. Glass vessels were now inexpensive compared to pottery vessels. A growth of the use of glass products occurred throughout the Roman world. Glass became the Roman plastic, and glass containers produced in Alexandria spread throughout the Roman Empire. With the discovery of clear glass (through the introduction of manganese dioxide), by glass blowers in Alexandria circa 100 AD, the Romans began to use glass for architectural purposes. Cast glass windows, albeit with poor optical qualities, began to appear in the most important buildings in Rome and the most luxurious villas of Herculaneum and Pompeii. Over the next 1,000 years glass making and working continued and spread through southern Europe and beyond.</English>

These became known in Europe as "alcohols," and in particular the distilled essence of intoxicating fermented drinks became known as "alcohol of wine." Due to the wild popularity of this discovery, and the development of more sophisticated chemical vocabulary in the 1800s, the very "alcohol" soon became synonymous with the intoxicating compound found in beer, wine, and other such drinks.[PARAGRAPH:2]Purification of alcohol, or increasing the concentration of alcohol in an existing solution, remains a major application of distillation to this day.

The role of the pharmacist has shifted from the classical "lick, stick, and pour" dispensary role (that is, "lick &amp; stick the labels, count &amp; pour the pills"), to being an integrated member of the health care team directly involved in patient care. Pharmacists undergo university-level education to understand biochemical mechanisms of action of drugs, drug uses and therapeutic roles, side effects, potential interactions, and monitoring parameters. This is mated to education in anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology. Professional interpretation and communication of this specialized knowledge to patients, physicians, and other health care providers are functions which pharmacists provide, and are central to the provision of safe and effective drug therapy.[PARAGRAPH:2]The most common pharmacist positions are that of a community pharmacist (also referred to as "retail pharmacist" or "dispensing chemist"), or a hospital pharmacist, where they instruct and counsel on the proper use and adverse effects of medically prescribed drugs and medicines. In most countries, the profession is subject to professional regulation. Depending on the legal scope of practice, pharmacists may contribute to prescribing (also referred to as "pharmacist prescriber") and administering certain medications (e.g. immunizations in some jurisdictions). Pharmacists may also practice in a variety of other settings, including industry, research, academia, military, and government.</English>

The unit grew from Menelik's personal Guard, although there are oral histories that link it to the elite fighting unit of Atse Tewodros II led by Fitawrari Gebrye. As Gebrye's military unit was among the few of Tewodros that remained when most of his army left, the assumption is not unreasonable if not conclusive. The title "Mehal Sefari" however was not used by any of Tewodros' units, nor by any other previous military unit.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Mehal Sefari's earlier roles were providing security for young Prince Menelik under the leadership of the later Dejazmach Germame. Upon the death of Atse Tewodros, 3 men - Wagshum Gobeze of Welo, Kassa Mircha of Tigre and Menelik of Shoa - were declared Atse. Kassa marched on Welo, defeated and imprisoned Gobeze, he marched south to Shewa to face Menelik who had gathered his forces and awaited him. Both rulers assumptive, Yohannes by virtue of arms left for him by the British and Menelik by blood sought reconciliation, Menelik agreeing to accept Yohannes as his Suzerain, much to the relief of the latter whose small, though well-armed forces were no match for the Shewan Army. Menelik's Army, though with fewer artillery pieces, had superiority in men, equipment and mounted cavalry. It would also have been fighting on home turf. Yohannes' spy sent to observe the Shoans is said to have come back to tell the Emperor "I thought clouds had descended on the ground, but it was the Shoans and their multitudes in their tents."[PARAGRAPH:2]Atse Menelik took this opportunity to continue to arm and train his men, dispatching men to the South and West in poses of providing security for the Emperor of Ethiopia and an elite infantry division. It was part of the organizational structure of the Ethiopian regular army as one of the 4 divisions that comprised the regular army. The Ethiopian Imperial Host included the 40,000 men and women of the Regular Army and the approximately 100,000 men and women of the National Guard/Biherawi Tor.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The origins of the Hashshashin, or Assassins, trace back to just before the First Crusade around 1080. It is difficult to find out much information about the origins of the Hashshashin because most early sources are either written by enemies of the cult or based on legends. Most sources dealing with the order's inner working were destroyed with the capture of Alamut, the Assassin's headquarters. However, it's possible to trace the beginnings of the cult back to its first Grandmaster, Hasan-i Sabbah.[PARAGRAPH:2]A passionate believer in the Isma'ili beliefs, Hasan-i-Sabbah was well liked throughout Cairo, Syria, and most of the Middle East by other Isam'ili, which led to a number of people becoming his followers. Using his fame and popularity, Sabbah founded the Order of the Assassins. While his motives for founding this order are ultimately unknown, it has been speculated that it was for his own political and personal gain and to also exact vengeance on his enemies. His motivation for political power probably came through what he thought to be dealings with other Muslims in the Middle East, particularly Sunnis, but because of the unrest in the holy land caused by the calling of the Crusades, Hasan-i-Sabbah found himself not only fighting for power with other Muslims, but also with the invading Christian forces.[PARAGRAPH:2]After creating the Order, Sabbah searched for a location that would be fit for a sturdy headquarters and decided on the fortress at Alamut in what is now North-western Iran. It is still disputed whether Sabbah built the fortress himself or if it was already built at the time of his arrival . Whether he created it himself or not, Sabbah adapted the fortress to suit his needs of not only defense from hostile forces, but also indoctrination of his followers. After laying claim to the fortress at Alamut, Sabbah began expanding his influence outward to nearby towns and districts, using his agents to gain political favour and intimidate the local populations.[PARAGRAPH:2]Spending most of his days at Alamut working on religious works and doctrines for his Order, Sabbah was never to leave his fortress again in his lifetime. He had established a secret society of deadly assassins, one which was built in a hierarchical format. Below Sabbah, the Grand Headmaster of the Order, was those known as "Greater Propagandists", followed by the normal "Propagandists", the Rafiqs ("Companions"), and the Lasiqs ("Adherents"). It was the Lasiqs which were trained to become some of the most feared assassins, or as they were called, "Fida'i" (self-sacrificing agent), in the known world.</English>

He reigned over the Kongo Empire from 1509 to late 1542 or 1543.[PARAGRAPH:2]Born Mvemba a Nzinga, son of Manikongo (Mwene Kongo) (king) Nzinga a Nkuwu, the fifth king of the Kongo dynasty. At the time of the first arrival of the Portuguese to the Kingdom of the Kongo's capital of Mbanza Kongo in 1491, Mvemba a Nzinga was in his thirties, and was the ruler of the Nsundi province (on the northeast), and likely heir to the throne. He added the name Afonso when he was baptized after his father decided to convert to Christianity. and studied with Portuguese priests and advisers for ten years in the kingdom's capital. Letters written by priests to the king of Portugal paint Afonso as an enthusiastic and scholarly convert to Christianity. In around 1495, the Manikongo denounced Christianity, and Afonso welcomed the priests into the capital of his Nsundi province. To the displeasure of many in the realm, he had traditional art objects that might offend Portuguese sensibilities destroyed. Afonso's alliance with the Portuguese was rewarded when he fought conservatives for succession to the throne. The victory over his brother in the Battle of Mbanza-Kongo "was won because of aid from Portuguese weapons."[PARAGRAPH:2]Virtually all that is known about Kongo in the time of Afonso's reign is known from his long series of letters, written in Portuguese primarily to the kings Manuel I and Jo&#227;o III of Portugal. The letters are often very long and give many details about the administration of the country. Many of the letters complain about the behavior of several Portuguese officials, and these letters have given rise to an interpretation of Afonso's reign as one in which Portuguese interests submerged Afonso's ambitions.[PARAGRAPH:2]In Adam Hochschild's 1998 book King Leopold's Ghost, Hochschild characterizes Afonso as a "selective modernizer" because he welcomed European scientific innovation and the church but refused to adopt Portugal's legal code and sell land to prospectors. In fact, Afonso ridiculed the Ordenacoes Manuelinas (new Portuguese law code) when he read them in 1516, asking the Portuguese emissary de Castro, "What is the punishment, Castro, for putting one's feet on the ground?" No contemporary record mentions anything about land sales, indeed land in Kongo was never sold to anyone.</English>

Since 1807 it has been the seat of the Patriarch of Venice, archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Venice. For its opulent design, gilded Byzantine mosaics, and its status as a symbol of Venetian wealth and power, from the 11th century on the building was known by the nickname Chiesa d'Oro (Church of gold).[PARAGRAPH:1]The first San Marco's was a temporary building in the Doge's Palace, constructed in 828, when Venetian merchants stole the supposed relics of San Marco the Evangelist from Alexandria.

The new church was burned in a rebellion in 976, rebuilt in 978 and again to form the basis of the present basilica since 1063. The basilica was consecrated in 1094, the same year in which the body of San Marco was supposedly rediscovered in a pillar by Vitale Faliero, doge at the time. The building also incorporates a low tower (now housing San Marco's Treasure), believed by some to have been part of the original Doge's Palace. Within the first half of the 13th century the narthex and the new fa&#231;ade were constructed, most of the mosaics were completed and the domes were covered with higher wooden, lead-covered domes in order to blend in with the Gothic architecture of the redesigned Doge's Palace.</English>

At 19, Caesar married Cornelia, daughter of a prominent member of the popular political faction.

Imagine their surprise when, after they released him, he did just that. The pirates had treated Caesar well during his captivity, however, so he mercifully slit their throats before nailing them to the crosses.[PARAGRAPH:2]Caesar began his climb to power. He was elected to the Senate, where he gave his support to Gnaeus Pompeius (Pompey the Great), who with Caesar's help was given command of the war against King Mithridates. He spoke at funerals, including the one of his wife, Cornelia, dazzling the crowds with his oratory skill and personal magnetism. He married the granddaughter of his old enemy, Sulla. He later divorced her because of rumors that she had had an affair, saying famously, "The wife of Caesar must be above suspicion." He spent lavishly on games to win popular support.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 60 BC, at the age of 40, Caesar entered into an alliance with Pompey and Crassus, two very important and influential men of Rome. He agreed to support their aims if they, in turn, would help him get elected to the consulship of Rome (at the time, Rome was ruled by two consuls, each elected for one-year terms). Upon being elected, Caesar pushed through measures that helped the other two men achieve their goals. At the end of his term, he strong-armed the Assembly into giving him a five-year term as the powerful proconsul of Gaul, and thus leader of a large portion of Rome's best troops.[PARAGRAPH:2]Caesar was to remain in the field of battle for the next nine years. During that time he conquered most of what is now Central Europe, adding "great general" to his already formidable reputation. During his absence, however, Crassus died in battle against the Parthians, and Pompey took sole control of Rome. Worse, Pompey was siding with Caesar's enemies, the Optimates. When Caesar was informed that the Optimates intended to prosecute him for his illegal actions in forcing the Assembly to give him the Gaul proconsul, he broke relations with Pompey.[PARAGRAPH:2]Having earned his legions firm loyalty and support, in 49 BC Caesar led them "across the Rubicon" and to Rome. Most of Pompey's legions at the time were in Spain, so he and the Senate abandoned the city to Caesar's legions. In a lightning campaign, Caesar destroyed Pompey's Spanish troops before his enemy could consolidate his forces, and Pompey retreated to Greece, where there remained forces still loyal to him. Caesar pursued as quickly as possible.[PARAGRAPH:2]Caesar's sea transportation was limited, and he could only support about 20,000 troops in Greece. He left behind his trusted lieutenant Marc Antony, ordering Antony to rectify the supply situation and get him more troops as soon as possible. Knowing, however, that Pompey was using every moment's delay to gather allies and increase his forces, Caesar couldn't wait; at the head of his now 21,000-strong army he marched to battle.[PARAGRAPH:2]The two armies met on the plains of Pharasulus, with Pompey's army outnumbering Caesar's by more than two-to-one. Despite the odds, Caesar was victorious, his brilliant generalship making up for his disadvantage in numbers. Pompey fled the field, and shortly thereafter was betrayed and murdered by the Egyptians. Now undisputed ruler of Rome, Caesar went to Egypt, where he set his lover Cleopatra upon the throne after a short but bitter fight.[PARAGRAPH:2]Back in Rome, Caesar began an extensive program of reforms. He began to resolve the Roman debt problem; he settled his veterans abroad, giving them the land they craved but not dispossessing others (other Romans, that is). He reformed the Roman calendar, regulated public assistance and strengthened the middle class. His actions greatly improved life for the average citizen, but angered the aristocracy, the remnants of the Optimate party.[PARAGRAPH:2]In February of 44 BC, the puppet Senate voted Caesar "dictator perpetuus," or dictator for life. For the first time he began wearing purple garb, a color associated at that time with kings and emperors. Further, he allowed his statues to be adorned like the statues of the gods. On March 15, Caesar was murdered, stabbed at least 23 times by a coalition of aristocrats and senators.</English>

		<Chinese>[H1]朱利乌斯·恺撒[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]罗马统治者[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]生卒年份：[\BOLD]约前100-前44年[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]背景:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]盖乌斯·朱利乌斯·恺撒传说是经由剖腹产而出生的。他父亲是罗马共和国的中级官员，并没有太多的权势或金钱。当恺撒的父亲去世时，他还是只是个十多岁的少年。他19岁那年娶了科妮莉亚为妻，而后者的家族属于罗马城里的一个政治派别。而当时罗马的独裁者苏拉却正好属于与之敌对的派系。他命令恺撒与科妮莉亚离婚，恺撒拒绝了，苏拉便下令处死恺撒。恺撒不得不逃进山中，直到他那些有权有势的朋友为他求得了独裁者的宽恕。[PARAGRAPH:1]在恺撒刚成年时，他作过各式各样的工作。他担任军官时，因为在战斗中营救同僚而获得奖励。他被派往卑斯尼亚，并成功地劝说那里的国王向罗马提供一支舰队。他还在罗马法院中担任律师，并由此锻炼了自己的雄辩术。[PARAGRAPH:1]在一次去希腊的旅行中，恺撒被海盗所绑架。当海盗要求他交出20塔伦作为自己的赎金时，他却愤怒地坚持他至少值50塔伦。他同这些海盗结交，还开玩笑地说一旦他获得自由，必将带人来这些海盗全部干掉。果不其然，在获得自由后，恺撒履行了自己的诺言。尽管海盗在恺撒被俘期间对他很好，但恺撒仍在处死海盗之前凶残地切开了他们的喉咙。[PARAGRAPH:1]在此之后恺撒一路顺风，首先是在格涅乌斯·庞培的支持下当选参议员，后者通过恺撒的协助获得了米特拉达梯战争的指挥权。他的演讲在此时已经可以让听众疯狂，在自己妻子科妮莉亚的丧礼上也是如此。之后，他娶了自己曾经的敌人苏拉的孙女。但他不久后又与之离婚，理由是传闻她私生活不检点，这就像一句谚语所说的那样，“身为恺撒妻，必须无可疑。”他为了争取公众的支持不惜一掷千金。[PARAGRAPH:1]在公元前60年，恺撒40岁时，他与罗马另外两个强势人物庞培及克拉苏结盟。恺撒答应支持他们的行动，其报酬是后两者必须支持自己当选罗马执政官（在那时，罗马由两个执政官统治，其任期为一年）。在自己当选后，恺撒就要尽其所能为庞培和克拉苏提供帮助。在恺撒任期最后一段时间，他运用铁腕手段为自己争取到了担任五年高卢总督的机会，这意味着他成为了罗马一大批精锐部队的长官。[PARAGRAPH:1]恺撒在接下来的九年里不停地作战。在此期间他征服了中欧的绝大部分地区，并因其赫赫威名而被称为“伟大的将军”。但是在他远离罗马的这段时间里，克拉苏在同帕提亚人的战争中丧命，庞培乘机控制了罗马城。更为糟糕的是，庞培现在同恺撒的敌人站在了一起。当恺撒得知到政敌将就自己使用不正常手段谋求高卢总督职位一事提起控告后，便决心同庞培决裂。[PARAGRAPH:1]恺撒在公元前49年率领自己忠心耿耿的部下“穿越共和国”向罗马进军。庞培手下的绝大多数军团当时正在西班牙作战，所以他和他的同盟者不得不将一座座空城留给恺撒。在一次奇袭中，恺撒趁庞培的西班牙军团尚未巩固战线前就打跨了他们，庞培接下来又撤往希腊，他在那里有着许多死忠者。恺撒也马上展开了追击。[PARAGRAPH:1]但恺撒的海上运输能力很有限，他只能将2万人运往希腊。他将自己可靠的部下马可·安东尼留在意大利，命令他维持补给线，并尽可能多的把部队提供给自己。但庞培正在利用对方的延误集结军力，恺撒知道自己不能再将战事无限拖延下去了，于是决定率领现有的2万1千人迅速投入战斗。[PARAGRAPH:1]两军在帕拉苏卢斯平原相遇，庞培和恺撒军队的数量之比是二对一。尽管处于劣势，恺撒仍然取得了胜利，他以自己的才略弥补了数量上的不足。庞培战败后逃到了埃及，但不久又被当地人谋杀。而作为罗马唯一统治者的恺撒来到了埃及，他在那里邂逅了自己的情人克利奥帕特拉，并将她抬上了埃及国王的宝座。[PARAGRAPH:1]在回到罗马后，恺撒开展了轰轰烈烈的改革。他着手解决罗马的债务问题，让自己手下的老兵移民海外，并给予他们一直渴望的土地，而且也没有以牺牲他人（仅指罗马人）的土地为代价。他改革了罗马的历法，调整官方补助，使中产阶级的实力得以扩大。他的一系列措施极大地提高了罗马市民的生活水准，但却触怒了贵族阶级保守派的残余势力。[PARAGRAPH:1]公元前44年2月，已成象征性傀儡的元老院任命恺撒为“终身执政官”。他开始穿着代表帝王身份的紫色长袍，甚至还允许象塑造神像那样塑造自己的雕像。3月15日，恺撒被共和派贵族和议员阴谋刺杀，政敌们在他身上留下了至少23道伤口。</Chinese>

He also ruled a vast empire in the Americas, including New Spain and Peru.[PARAGRAPH:2]Philip's policies were determined by a combination of Catholic fervour and dynastic self-interest. He found himself by default the chief defender of Catholic Europe, both against the Ottoman Turks and against the forces of the Protestant Reformation. He never relented from his war against heresy, preferring to fight on every front at whatever cost rather than countenance heterodoxy within his territories. These territories included his patrimony in the Netherlands, where the Protestant heresy had taken deep root. Following the Revolt of the Netherlands in 1568, Philip waged a long war for control of the Netherlands, which dragged in the English and the French and lasted for the rest of his life. In 1588, the Spanish armada was destroyed by a tempest off the southern cost of Ireland, thus thwarting his planned invasion of England. Concerned with the Muslim threat in the Mediterranean, Philip achieved a decisive victory against the Turks at the Lepanto in 1571, where the fleet of the Holy League was commanded by his illegitimate brother John of Austria. He also successfully secured his succession to the throne of Portugal in 1580.[PARAGRAPH:2]After basing himself in the Netherlands in the early years of his reign, Philip returned to the peninsula in 1559 and never left it again. Unlike his father, Charles V, Philip was thoroughly Spanish, a native speaker who chose to rule from Spain rather than to travel constantly around his states. Although sometimes described as an absolute monarch, Philip faced many constitutional constraints on his authority. Spain was not a single monarchy with one legal system but a federation of separate realms, each jealously guarding its own rights against those of the Crown of Castile. In practice, Philip often found his authority overruled by local assemblies, and his word was less authoritarian than British or French historians have always tried to characterize. The Kingdom of Aragon, where Philip was obliged to put down a rebellion in 1591&#150;1592, was particularly unruly. He also grappled with the intractable problem of the large Morisco population in Spain, persuaded to convert to Christianity by his predecessors. In 1568, a Morisco Revolt broke out in the southern province of Granada in defiance of attempts to suppress Moorish customs, and Philip wisely decided the expulsion of the Moriscos from Granada and their dispersal to other provinces.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite its immense dominions, Spain itself was an arid country with a sparse population that yielded a limited income to the crown. Philip faced major difficulties in raising taxes, the collection of which was largely farmed out to local lords. He was able to finance his military campaigns not only by taxing the local resources of his empire, but also the flow of income from the New World proved vital to his militant foreign policy. His exchequer several times was able to avoid bankruptcy. Philip's reign saw an extraordinary flourishing of cultural excellence in Spain, part of what is called the Golden Age, creating a lasting legacy in literature, music, and the visual arts.</English>

		<English>[TAB]In the late 15th century, King John II had designed a defence system for the mouth of the Tagus that depended on the fortresses of Cascais and S&#227;o Sebasti&#227;o (or Torre Velha) in Caparica on the south side of the river. These fortresses did not completely protect the river's mouth, and further protection was required. In his "Chronicle of John II" (Chronica de D. Joao II), which appeared in 1545, the author Garcia de Resende affirmed the king's opinion that the defences of Lisbon were inadequate, and that he had insisted on building fortifications along the entrance to the River Tagus to supplement the existing defences. To this end, he ordered the "making of a strong fort", but died before any plans were drawn. King Manuel I of Portugal revisited the proposal twenty years later and ordered the construction of a military fortification on the northern margin of the Tagus at Bel&#233;m. In 1513, Louren&#231;o Fernandes wrote a letter to his friends referring to the king's intention of constructing a tower near Restelo Velho, having determined it to be essential.[PARAGRAPH:2]The project was started on a basaltic rock outcrop a short distance from the riverbank, using some of the stone being collected to build the Monastery of Santa Maria de Bel&#233;m. The tower was designed by military architect Francisco de Arruda, named "Master of the works of the Bel&#233;m stronghold" by King Manuel, and in 1516 he began receiving 763 blocks and 504 stones for its construction, delivered by Diogo Rodrigues, treasurer for the project. As construction progressed, a man-of-war called the Grande Nau (Great Ship), a heavily armed, 1000-ton ship continued to guard the estuary at the mouth of the Tagus until the fort's completion.[PARAGRAPH:2]The building was finished in 1519, just two years before Manuel's death, and Gaspar de Paiva was temporarily stationed to command the fortress; his commission was made permanent on 15 September 1521, when he was appointed the first Captain-General, or alcalde, and the fortress was named the Castle of St Vincent (Castelo de S&#227;o Vicente de Bel&#233;m), in honour of the patron saint of Lisbon.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1571, Francisco de Holanda advised the monarch that it was necessary to improve the coastal defences in order to protect the kingdom's capital. He suggested the construction of a "strong and impregnable" fort that could easily defend Lisbon and that the Bel&#233;m Tower "should be strengthened, repaired and completed...that it has cost so much without being completed". D'Holanda designed an improved rectangular bastion with several turrets. In 1580, after a few hours of battle, the garrison stationed in the tower surrendered to Spanish forces under the command of the Duke of Alba. After this defeat, the dungeons of the tower served as a prison until 1830. It was also during the last quarter of the 16th century that the construction of the Philippine Barracks began. A rectangular two-storey space was constructed over the bastion, giving the tower the visual profile that it has retained to the present, with sculpted crosses of the Order of Christ and domed turrets.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1589, Philip I of Portugal ordered Italian engineer Friar Jo&#227;o Vicenzio Casale to build a well-defended fort to be constructed in place of the "useless castle of S&#227;o Vicente". The engineer submitted three designs, proposing that the bastion would be surrounded by another bastion of greater dimensions, but the project never materialized.[PARAGRAPH:2]A 1633 codex for the House of Cadaval was inserted into one of the floors, in one of the arches of the barracks, and in the four largest arches at the top of the southern fa&#231;ade. Similarly, a reference to the year 1655 was inscribed on a plaque placed on the northern wall of the cloister, which certified the tower's function as a customs control point and for navigation along the Tagus; vessels were obliged to pay a tax as they entered the harbour, which was imposed incrementally.[PARAGRAPH:2]Between 1780 and 1782, under the reign of Maria I of Portugal, General Guilherme de Valler&#233; constructed the Forte do Bom Sucesso, whose battery was connected by a western corridor wall to the tower. When French forces invaded Lisbon during the Peninsular War, detachments of their troops were quartered in the tower from 1808 to 1814. After the French retreated, Lord Beresford advised that coastal artillery batteries should be reinforced along the Tagus, and specifically noted that stronger batteries should be placed on the sides of the tower's bastion, with carts placed to better protect the soldiers, since the walls were very low.[PARAGRAPH:2]King Miguel I (1828-1834) used the dungeons to imprison his liberal opponents, while another level was used as a custom house for ships until the duty on foreign ships was abolished in 1833. The tower received military upgrades in 1589 and 1809-1814.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the reign of Maria II, Almeida Garrett protested the site's degradation and under the persuasion of the Duke of Terceira, renovations were begun by military engineer Ant&#243;nio de Azevedo e Cunha. He demolished the Philippine barracks and extended revivalist elements in 1845-46 (such as the armoured merlons, the balustrade of the veranda along the southern fa&#231;ade, the laced fascia in the cloister and the niche with an image of the Virgin and Child).[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1865-67 a beacon was installed on the southeast terrace of the building and a telegraph service was started, while nearby a gas factory was built, producing smoke that prompted many protests. The first moves to preserve and rehabilitate the tower began in the latter part of the 20th century. First, the tower was transferred to the Ministry of Finance in 1940, which undertook small conservation works. Then the military quarters on the battlements were removed and the inner cloister was built. The architectural landscape designer Ant&#243;nio Viana Barreto began a three-year project in 1953 to integrate the tower with the local shoreline. In 1983 the site hosted the 17th European Exhibition on Art, Science and Culture, and various projects involving the building were undertaken, among them covering the cloister with a transparent plastic cupola. In the same year the Bel&#233;m Tower was classified by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the 1990s, the property was transferred to the Instituto Portugu&#234;s do Patrim&#243;nio Arquitect&#243;nico (forerunner of IGESPAR), which began a full restoration of the building that lasted from February 1997 to January 1998; this included reinforcing the tower and bastion, reinforcing the south balcony supports with stainless steel rods and epoxy resin, treating the mortar joints, and general structural cleaning. The statues of Saint Vincent of Saragossa and the Archangel Michael received the same treatment. In 1999 the project received the Europa Nostra award for its restoration of the exterior. The Bel&#233;m Tower was added on 7 July 2007 to the registry of the Seven Wonders of Portugal.</English>

Joao II）中确认国王的观点，即里斯本的防御力不足，他坚持在入口沿线设防工事。到塔霍河，以补充现有的防御。为此，他下令“建造一个坚固的堡垒”，但在制定任何计划之前就死了。二十年后，葡萄牙国王曼努埃尔一世重新考虑了该提议，并下令在贝伦塔霍河北缘建造军事防御工事。 1513年，洛伦索·费尔南德斯（Louren&#231;oFernandes）给他的朋友写了一封信，信中说国王打算在雷斯特洛·维略（Restelo Velho）附近建造一座塔楼。[PARAGRAPH：2]该项目是在离该地块不远的玄武岩露头上开始的河岸，使用收集的一些石头建造圣玛丽亚德贝伦修道院。该塔由军事建筑师弗朗西斯科·德·阿鲁达（Francisco de Arruda）设计，被曼努埃尔国王命名为“贝伦要塞的工程大师”。1516年，他开始接收763个砌块和504块石头，由该项目的财务主管Diogo Rodrigues交付。 。随着施工的进行，一个名为1000吨重的全副武装的战舰Grande Nau（大船）继续守卫塔霍河口的河口，直到堡垒建成。[PARAGRAPH：2]于1519年完工，距曼努埃尔死前仅两年。加斯帕·德·帕瓦（Gaspar de Paiva）被临时驻扎指挥堡垒。 1521年9月15日，他被任命为第一任上尉，将其任命永久化。为了纪念里斯本的守护神，这座堡垒被命名为圣文森特城堡（Castelo deS&#227;oVicente deBelém）。 [PARAGRAPH：2] 1571年，弗朗西斯科·德·奥兰达（Francisco de Holanda）告诉君主，有必要改善沿海防御系统，以保护王国的首都。他建议建造一个“坚固而坚不可摧”的堡垒，该堡垒可以轻松地保卫里斯本，贝伦塔则“应该得到加强，修复和竣工……它的造价如此之高，没有完工”。 D'Holanda设计了带有多个炮塔的改进型矩形堡垒。 1580年，经过数小时的战斗，驻守在塔楼的驻军在阿尔巴公爵的指挥下向西班牙军队投降。在这次失败之后，塔的地牢一直用作监狱，直到1830年。也是在16世纪的最后一个季度，才开始建造菲律宾兵营。在该堡垒上方建造了一个矩形的两层高空间，给塔提供了至今为止保留的视觉轮廓，带有雕刻的基督勋章和圆顶塔楼。[PARAGRAPH：2] 1589年，葡萄牙的菲利普一世命令意大利工程师FriarJo&#227;oVicenzio Casale建造一座防御完善的堡垒，以取代“无用的圣维森特城堡”。工程师提交了三项设计，建议该堡垒将被另一个更大尺寸的堡垒包围，但该项目从未实现。[PARAGRAPH：2]一个Cadaval屋的1633法典被插入其中一层，其中一层军营的拱门，以及南立面顶部的四个最大的拱门。同样，在回廊北壁的匾额上刻有1655年的文字，该匾额证明了塔的功能是作为海关控制点并沿塔霍河航行。船只进入港口时有义务缴税，该税是逐步征收的。[PARAGRAPH：2]在1780年和1782年之间，吉列尔姆·德·瓦莱雷将军在葡萄牙的玛丽亚一世统治下，建造了Bote Sucesso堡，其炮台通过西侧走廊的墙壁连接至塔楼。当法国军队在半岛战争中入侵里斯本时，从1808年到1814年，其支队驻扎在塔中。法国撤退后，贝雷斯福德勋爵建议在塔霍河沿岸加强海岸炮兵连，并特别指出，应加强炮兵[PARAGRAPH：2]米格尔一世国王（1828-1834）用地牢囚禁了他的自由派敌人，而另一只则被囚禁在塔堡垒的两侧，并用推车更好地保护了士兵。在1833年废除对外国船只的关税之前，该建筑被用作船只的习俗。塔在1589年和1809-1814年进行了军事升级。[PARAGRAPH：2]在玛丽亚二世统治期间，阿尔梅达·加勒特（Almeida Garrett）抗议该遗址的退化在Terceira公爵的劝说下，军事工程师Antóniode Azevedo e Cunha进行了翻新。 [他在1845-46年间拆毁了菲律宾的军营，并扩大了复兴主义的元素（例如装甲的梅隆人，沿着南立面的阳台栏杆，回廊中带花边的面板和带有圣母子形象的壁n）。[段落：2]在1865-67年，在该建筑物的东南露台上安装了一个信标，并开始了电报服务，同时在附近建造了一家煤气厂，产生的烟雾引发了许多抗议活动。保护和修复塔楼的第一个举动始于20世纪下半叶。首先，该塔楼于1940年移交给财政部，后者进行了小型保护工程。然后撤走了城垛上的军事区，并建造了内部回廊。建筑景观设计师安东尼奥·维亚纳·巴雷托（AntónioViana Barreto）于1953年开始了为期三年的项目，将塔楼与当地海岸线整合在一起。 1983年，该场馆举办了第17届欧洲艺术，科学和文化展览，并进行了涉及该建筑的各种项目，其中包括一个带有透明塑料冲天炉的回廊。同年，贝伦塔被联合国教科文组织列为世界遗产。[参数：2]在1990年代，该物业被移交给葡萄牙古罗马建筑学院（IGESPAR的前身）。持续时间为1997年2月至1998年1月的建筑物；其中包括加固塔楼和堡垒，用不锈钢棒和环氧树脂加固南阳台支撑，处理砂浆缝以及进行总体结构清洁。萨拉戈萨（Saragossa）的圣文森特（Saint Vincent）雕像和大天使迈克尔（Angarel Michael）的雕像受到同样的待遇。 1999年，该项目的外墙修复获得了Europa Nostra奖。贝伦塔（BelémTower）于2007年7月7日被添加到葡萄牙的七大奇观中。</Chinese>

It was built from 1555-61 on orders from Ivan the Terrible and commemorates the capture of Kazan and Astrakhan. A world famous landmark, it has been the hub of the cities growth since the 14th century and was the cities tallest building until the completion of the Ivan the Great Bell Tower in 1600.[PARAGRAPH:1]The original building, known as Trinity Church and later Trinity Cathedral, contained eight side churches arranged around the ninth, central church of Intercession; the tenth church was erected in 1588 over the grave of venerated local saint Vasily (Basil). In the 16th and 17th centuries the church, perceived as the earthly symbol of the Heavenly City, as happens to all churches in Byzantine Christianity, was popularly known as the "Jerusalem" and served as an allegory of the Jerusalem Temple in the annual Palm Sunday parade attended by the Patriarch of Moscow and the tsar.[PARAGRAPH:1]The building is shaped as a flame of a bonfire rising into the sky, a design that has no analogues in Russian architecture. Dmitry Shvidkovsky, in his book Russian Architecture and the West, states that "it is like no other Russian building. Nothing similar can be found in the entire millennium of Byzantine tradition from the fifth to fifteenth century ... a strangeness that astonishes by its unexpectedness, complexity and dazzling interleaving of the manifold details of its design." The cathedral foreshadowed the climax of Russian national architecture in the 17th century.[PARAGRAPH:1]As part of the program of state atheism, the church was confiscated from the Russian Orthodox community as part of the Soviet Union's anti-theist campaigns and has operated as a division of the State Historical Museum since 1928.

		<English>[TAB]The Ottoman Empire was a Turkish state situated upon the eastern Mediterranean that lasted for some 630 years, from 1299 - 1922 AD. At the height of its power, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the Ottoman domains stretched across vast regions in Anatolia, the Balkans, the Near East and northern Africa. For several centuries it was one of the foremost military powers in the world (until it began to stagnate technologically and fell far behind its competitors).[PARAGRAPH:2]The Ottoman state began as a vassal of the earlier Seljuk Turks, who had formed a large empire in the Near East in the eleventh century. When the Seljuk state of Rum in Anatolia collapsed, the Ottomans took advantage of the ensuing power vacuum and rose in power. According to tradition, Osman I became the bey, or chief, of the state of S&#246;?&#252;t in 1281. When Osman captured the Byzantine city of Bilecik in 1299, he declared his state's independence from the Seljuks. This is the traditional date given as the foundation of the Ottoman Empire - which was named after its first leader, Osman. [PARAGRAPH:2]The Ottomans expanded rapidly in Anatolia throughout the fourteenth century. A series of capable military leaders made many gains against the tottering Byzantine state. The important cities of Nicaea and Nicomedia fell in 1331 and 1337, and by the 1360s the Ottomans had crossed over into Europe and began capturing territory in Thrace. As a sign of this growing power, Murad I declared himself a sultan (or king) in 1383. Around the year 1400, Timur invaded Anatolia. This caused a great deal of disruption, but the Ottomans bounced back and continued to make territorial gains. Under the rule of Mehmed II, the Ottomans attacked and captured Constantinople, whose mighty walls finally fell to the cannon of the Ottomans. This destroyed the Byzantine Empire, and the Ottomans made Constantinople their capital. Mehmed II became known as "Mehmed the Conqueror." Suleiman I, also known as Suleiman the Magnificent, continued to expand and consolidate the Empire; the Ottomans were at the height of their power and influence during his reign[PARAGRAPH:2]After the capture of Constantinople the Ottoman state virtually adopted the Byzantine civil service to run the empire, and its administration was generally sound (until the nineteenth century, when it began to fossilize and became outdated). The Ottoman Empire was very much a pre-modern dynastic state, made up of many different nationalities - in fact, Greeks largely ran its bureaucracy and were vital to its continued success. Militarily, the Ottomans were very strong largely because of their early adoption of gunpowder and their powerful cavalry forces. The military also employed elite slave soldiers known as "janissaries" who won victory after victory for the expanding Ottoman state. The military remained powerful until the late eighteenth century, when they fell fatally behind Western Europe in military technology. [PARAGRAPH:2]The Ottomans were known for their religious tolerance. The Empire was an Islamic state, and Islamic law dominated its legal system, but non-Muslims were generally well treated and enjoyed the freedom to worship their own religion. The Ottoman Empire was long seen as a refuge for Jews across Europe. Economically, the Ottoman Empire was somewhat of a failure. Most of the region's commerce was carried on by Greek or Italian merchants, which slowed the development of Turkish industry. Once the European voyages of exploration found new routes to India and China which did not involve passing through the Near East, the Ottoman Empire began a slow commercial decline. [PARAGRAPH:2]By the start of the nineteenth century, the Ottoman Empire still held enormous amounts of land, but the empire was stagnant and corrupt, and was widely viewed as the "sick man of Europe." The western powers, their commercial and military strength exploding under the influence of the Industrial Revolution, began to snap up vulnerable Ottoman territories. Britain and France forced humiliating commercial treaties on the Ottomans, and the Ottoman state was forced to take out massive loans to cover its debts - the start of a vicious cycle which only incurred more debt for the empire. [PARAGRAPH:2]While some positive reforms were carried out in terms of modernizing the Ottoman state, custom and tradition prevented the reformers from moving fast enough. Furthermore, the rising tide of nationalism began to tear the empire apart, as Serbians, Bulgarians, Romanians, and Greeks all declared their independence and set up their own nations. By the outbreak of World War I, the Ottomans had lost virtually all of their holdings in Europe. Desperate to preserve what was left, the Ottomans threw in their lot with the Central Powers (Germany and Austria), only to be defeated by a British-led Arab revolt in the Near East. When the war ended the victors partitioned and dissolved the Ottoman Empire at the Paris peace conference. However, the Turkish Revolution prevented the planned division of Anatolia from taking place.

		<Chinese>奥斯曼帝国最初是一个位于地中海东岸的土耳其人（土库曼人）小邦，至今约有630年的历史（1299-1922）。在其处于力量巅峰时期的16至17世纪，奥斯曼帝国的领土包括安纳托利亚、巴尔干、近东及北非的大部分地区，并拥有世界上最强大的军事实力（但后来其发展陷入停滞，开始落后于欧洲列强）。[PARAGRAPH:2]奥斯曼最初只是塞尔柱土耳其的附庸，塞尔柱土耳其是11世纪时近东地区的一个大帝国。当塞尔柱人在安纳托利亚地区的统治崩溃之后，奥斯曼人抓住时机开始崛起。据记载，奥斯曼一世于1281年成为索古特邦的拜伊（首领）。1299年他率军攻占拜占庭帝国的城市比莱奇克之后，他宣布脱离塞尔柱独立建国。这被认为是奥斯曼帝国建立的标志——帝国的名称也是来自于她的创立者奥斯曼一世。[PARAGRAPH:2]整个14世纪，奥斯曼人在安纳托利亚迅速扩张。一系列能力出众的军事领袖使其从风雨飘摇的拜占庭帝国夺取了大片土地。地位显要的重镇尼西亚和尼科美迪亚分别于1331年和1337年落入奥斯曼人之手，到14世纪60年代，奥斯曼人已跨越海峡进入欧洲，开始控制色雷斯地区。随着实力的不断增强，穆拉德一世于1383年宣布自己为“苏丹”（国王）。到1400年左右，帖木儿率军入侵安纳托利亚，对奥斯曼人造成了巨大的打击，但奥斯曼人很快恢复了元气，重新开始扩张。在穆罕默德二世统治时期，奥斯曼人凭借大炮的威力攻占了君士坦丁堡，灭亡了拜占庭帝国，并将君士坦丁堡定为新首都。穆罕默德二世也因此获得了“征服者穆罕默德”的称号。苏莱曼一世（“苏莱曼大帝”）继续帝国的扩张与巩固事业，在他的统治下，奥斯曼帝国达到其力量与影响的顶峰。[PARAGRAPH:2]在占领君士坦丁堡后，奥斯曼人实际上开始依靠拜占庭所建立的一套文官制度管理整个帝国，政府机构基本运转良好（但到19世纪时这套制度已变得僵化过时）。奥斯曼帝国是一个传统型的封建王朝，境内居住着各位不同的族群——事实上，希腊人是帝国官僚系统的最主要组成部分。在军事方面，奥斯曼帝国具有很强的实力，这主要是因为其迅速引入了火器，并拥有强大的骑兵部队。奥斯曼军队还包括一支由奴隶战士组成的精锐部队“苏丹亲兵”，这支部队在帝国的扩张战争中发挥了巨大的作用。但到18世纪晚期，奥斯曼的军事实力走向衰落，在军事技术方面严重落后于欧洲列强。[PARAGRAPH:2]奥斯曼帝国实行宽松的宗教政策。虽然伊斯兰教是官方信仰，伊斯兰法主导着帝国的司法系统，但非穆斯林也受到良好的对待，可以自由地信奉各自的神灵。奥斯曼帝国长期被欧洲各地的犹太人视为他们的避难所。在经济方面，可以说奥斯曼帝国做得相当失败。各地的商业活动主要被希腊和意大利商人所把持，这导致土耳其民族工业的发展陷于停滞。随着开始大航海时代的到来，欧洲人建立了通向印度和中国的新商路，无须再经过近东地区，奥斯曼帝国在商业上日益衰退。[PARAGRAPH:2]到19世纪初，奥斯曼帝国虽然仍控制着大片领土，但帝国的根基已经腐败变质，被世人视为“欧洲病夫”。西方列强的经济军事实力由于工业革命的影响而呈现爆炸性的增长，他们不断蚕食日益衰落的奥斯曼帝国的领地。英国和法国迫使奥斯曼帝国签订屈辱的商业条约，奥斯曼人为弥补国债而不断大量贷款——由此形成恶性循环，帝国的债务变得越来越多。[PARAGRAPH:2]虽然奥斯曼人积极尝试进行现代化改革，强大的传统习惯势力却使得改革者步履维艰。与此同时，民族主义浪潮也开始兴起，将帝国冲得四分五裂，塞尔维亚人、保加利亚人、罗马尼亚人以及希腊人纷纷宣布独立建国。到第一次世界大战爆发时，奥斯曼人实际上已经失去了几乎所有的欧洲领地。为了保住剩余的领土，奥斯曼人将赌注押在中欧强权（德国和奥匈帝国）身上，结果却是一场惨败。英国人帮助阿拉伯人在近东发动大规模起义。到大战结束时，战胜国通过凡尔赛和约使奥斯曼帝国走向解体。然而，进一步分割安纳托利亚的企图被土耳其革命的爆发所阻止。随着土耳其共和国于1922年成立，末代苏丹穆罕默德六世被废黜，奥斯曼帝国的历史也走到了尽头。[PARAGRAPH:2]</Chinese>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_UNIT_SKIRMISHER_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]While the warfare of civilized states in the Bronze and Iron ages frequently revolved around clashes between large blocks of men with hand to hand combat weapons, virtually all societies made use of lighter-armed forces as well. Infantry with armor and locked into a fighting formation could not move faster than a slow walk, nor could they maintain unit cohesion in rough terrain. Therefore, it was necessary to employ men with lighter equipment and with weapons suitable for striking from a distance, and then retreating to fight another day.[PARAGRAPH:2]Such tactics are known as "skirmishing," because they typically involve relatively small scale confrontations between smaller units, rather than massed exchanges of firepower or shock between large armies. Even nations legendary for their highly trained and deadly shock troops (such as the Greek phalanx and the Roman legions) routinely employed auxiliary units armed with bows, slings, and javelins for skirmishing tactics.[PARAGRAPH:2]The skirmishers rarely defeated an enemy by themselves, but their harassment forced the enemy army to deploy sooner to meet a new threat, and their swifter movement allowed them to scout the enemy more efficiently. Moreover, their ranged attacks could weaken the enemy's heavy troops or draw them out of position and leave them vulnerable to the heavy troops of one's own side. The best counter to this was to employ one's own skirmishers to fight back, since simply doubling up heavy infantry did not make them more effective at pursuing the skirmisher.[PARAGRAPH:2]In later eras, cavalry tended to compete for the skirmisher's role, since a mounted man can generally move faster than a man on foot - and carry more armor and weapons in case he comes into conflict with the foot skirmisher! Despite this, the concept of skirmishing in infantry warfare persisted through the gunpowder age, though. For instance, infantry armed with rifles (in those days, slower to reload than normal muskets) were often employed to snipe, harass, and disrupt blocks of pikemen and musketeers, then fall back upon the main body as the clash of arms approached, just as in ancient times.[PARAGRAPH:2]Eventually, after the great advances in the range and volume of fire available to handheld firearms, it became clear that standing in large blocks and relying on sheer volume of firepower to suppress the enemy was not working. As a result, foot soldiers began making heavier use of cover and coordination with inherently more powerful combat arms such as tanks and artillery. Today, virtually all infantry fight with tactics more similar to those of the light infantry skirmishers of three hundred years ago, and far less like the heavy infantry of the same era.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_CIV_AZTEC_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]The origin of the Aztec people is uncertain, but elements of their own tradition suggest that they were a tribe of hunter-gatherers on the northern Mexican plateau before their appearance in Meso-America in the 12th century. The Aztec were so called for Aztlan ("White Land"), an allusion to their origins in northern Mexico. It is possible that their migration southward was part of a general movement of peoples that followed, or perhaps helped trigger, the collapse of the Toltec civilization. The Aztecs settled on islands in Lake Texcoco and in 1325 founded Tenochtitlan, which remained their chief city. The basis of the Aztecs' success in creating a great state and ultimately an empire was their remarkable system of agriculture, which featured intensive cultivation of all available land, as well as elaborate systems of irrigation and reclamation of swampland. The high productivity gained by these methods made for a rich and populous state. The empire the Aztecs established was equaled in the New World only by that of the Incas of Peru, and the brilliance of their civilization is comparable to that of other great ancient cultures of the New and the Old World.[PARAGRAPH:2]Under a succession of ambitious kings they established a dominion that eventually stretched over most of present-day Mexico. By commerce and conquest, Tenochtitlan came to rule an empire of 400 to 500 small states, comprising by 1519 some five to six million people spread over 80,000 square miles. Valor in war, notably in the feared Jaguar Warrior formations, was the surest path to advancement in Aztec society, which was caste- and class-divided but nonetheless vertically fluid. The priestly and bureaucratic classes were involved in the administration of the empire, while at the bottom of society were classes of serfs, indentured servants, and outright slaves. The incredible story of a wandering tribe that was able to build an empire in one century (from the beginning of the 14th century to the beginning of the 15th) can be largely explained by three main factors: the Aztec religion, the thriving trade routes centered on Tenochtilan, and Aztec military organization. In 1502 the ninth emperor Montezuma II (1502-1520) succeeded his uncle Ahuitzotl as the leader of an empire that had reached its greatest extent, stretching from what is now northern Mexico to Honduras and Nicaragua. The Aztec empire was still expanding, and its society still evolving, when its progress was halted in 1519 by the appearance of Spanish adventurers.[PARAGRAPH:2]For all its apparent strength, the Aztec Empire had vulnerabilities that the Spanish were able to exploit. Aztec rule was based upon a system of tribute and fear over the surrounding peoples; every year, they were forced to pay the Aztecs money, goods, and a supply of captives to be sacrificed on the altar. Taking advantage of this resentment of their Aztec overlords, the tiny Spanish force was able to attract a massive army of some 30,000 Mesoamericans of many different tribes. After mistaking the Spanish for gods and inviting them into Tenochtitlan, Montezuma was taken prisoner by Hernando Cortes and died in custody. Montezuma's successors, Cuitlahuac and Cuauhtemoc, were unable to stave off the force raised by the conquistadors and, with the Spanish sack of Tenochtitlan in 1521, the Aztec empire came to an end.</English>

		<Chinese>阿兹特克人的具体起源尚无法确定，不过根据其本身的传说所透露的信息，可以推测他们在公元12世纪到达中美洲之前，是一个在墨西哥高原上以捕猎和采集为生的部族。“阿兹特克人”得名于“阿兹特兰”，意为“白色的土地”，似乎暗示着他们是来自于北墨西哥。他们的南迁可能与托尔特克文明的衰亡及其后大规模的民族迁徙有关，甚至可能是该古文明衰亡的直接原因。南迁后的阿兹特克人定居于特斯科科湖中的群岛，并于1325年在此建立了特诺奇蒂特兰城，此后该城的重要地位一直得以保持。阿兹特克得以成功建立强大的国家甚至后来的大帝国，一个重要的基础就是他们优良的农业技术，几乎每寸可用土地都获得精耕细作，通过建立复杂的灌溉系统，排干沼泽。这一切都提供了极高的农业生产力，足以支持富庶的城市和众多的人口。阿兹特克人所建立的帝国在新大陆上只有秘鲁的印加帝国能够匹敌，其文明的辉煌程度完全不逊色于新旧大陆上其他任何伟大的古文明。[PARAGRAPH:2]连续数代野心勃勃的国王使得帝国的疆界覆盖了现今的墨西哥的绝大部分地区。通过由商业扩张和武力征服，特诺奇蒂特兰统治着由四五百个小邦组成的巨大帝国。在1519年其人口达五百至六百万，面积超过八万平方英里。通过英勇作战，成为令人畏惧的美洲虎战士队伍中的一员，是阿兹特克人提升自己社会地位的最佳途径，他们的社会虽然等级森严，但还是可以上下流动的。祭司与官僚阶级可以参与帝国的管理，而社会的最底层则包括农奴、佣工以及奴隶。一个游牧民族居然仅用一个世纪的时间（约14世纪初至15世纪初）就能够建立这样一个庞大的帝国，是由于三个最重要的因素：阿兹特克人的宗教信仰，以特诺奇蒂特兰为中心的繁荣商路，以及阿兹特克人的军事组织。1502年，蒙特祖玛二世（1502-1520在位）继其叔父阿辉佐特尔之后成为阿兹特克帝国的第九任统治者，此时的帝国已达到了强盛的顶峰，控制范围自今墨西哥北部一直延伸到到洪都拉斯和尼加拉瓜。但是阿兹特克帝国的扩张及其社会的发展随着1519年西班牙的冒险家的到达而突然中断。[PARAGRAPH:2]阿兹特克帝国表面上虽然非常强大，但西班牙人发现其内部存在着许多弱点。阿兹特克依靠武力强迫周围民族向其纳贡。每年这些小民族都要上缴大量财物，以及用于献祭的活人。一小股西班牙武装利用这些民族对阿兹特克统治者的反抗情绪，因而召集到来自中美洲各部族的军队共三万多人。而蒙特祖玛却将西班牙人奉若神明，邀请他们访问特诺奇蒂特兰，结果被赫尔南多·科尔特斯抓获并死于狱中。他的继任者奎特拉华克和库奥提莫克均无法击退西班牙征服者，最终西班牙人于1521年攻占特诺奇蒂特兰，阿兹特克帝国就此灭亡。</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]The Oghuz, Oguz or Ghuzz Turks were a western Turkic people who spoke the Oghuz languages from the Common branch of Turkic language family. The name Oghuz is a Common Turkic word for "tribe". By the 10th century, Islamic sources were calling Muslim Oghuzes, as opposed to shamanists or Buddhists, of Turkmens. By the 12th century, this term had passed into Byzantine usage and the Oghuz were overwhelmingly Muslim. [PARAGRAPH:2]Oghuz warriors served in almost all Islamic armies of the Middle East from the 1000s onwards, in Byzantium from the 800's, and even in Spain and Morocco. In later centuries, they adapted and applied their own traditions and institutions to the ends of the Islamic world and emerged as empire-builders with a constructive sense of statecraft. The militarism that the Oghuz empires were very well known for was rooted in their centuries-long nomadic lifestyle. [PARAGRAPH:2]In general, they were a herding society that possessed certain military advantages that sedentary societies did not have, particularly mobility. Alliances by marriage and kinship, and systems of "social distance" based on family relationships were the connective tissues of their society. In Oghuz traditions, "society was simply the result of the growth of individual families".</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Turkic peoples are a collection of ethnic groups that live in central, eastern, northern, and western Asia as well as parts of eastern Europe. They speak languages belonging to the Turkic language family and share, to varying degrees, certain cultural traits and historical backgrounds. Traditional national and cultural symbols of the Turkic peoples include wolves in Turkic mythology and tradition; as well as the color blue, iron, and fire. Turquoise blue (the word turquoise comes from the French word meaning "Turkish") is the color of the stone turquoise still used in jewelry and as a protection against evil eye.[PARAGRAPH:2]The term Turkic represents a broad ethno-linguistic group of peoples including existing societies such as Altai, Azerbaijanis, Balkars, Bashkirs, Chuvashes, Crimean Karaites, Gagauz, Karachays, Karakalpaks, Kazakhs, Khakas, Krymchaks, Kyrgyz people, Nogais, Qashqai, Tatars, Turkmens, Turkish people, Tuvans, Uyghurs, Uzbeks, and Yakuts and as well as ancient and medieval states such as Dingling, Bulgars, Alat, Basmyl, Onogurs, Shatuo, Chuban, G&#246;kt&#252;rks, Oghuz Turks, Kankalis, Khazars, Khiljis, Kipchaks, Kumans, Karluks, Bahri Mamluks, Ottoman Turks, Seljuk Turks, Tiele, Timurids, Turgeshes, Yenisei Kirghiz, and possibly Huns, Tuoba, Xiongnu. It is generally agreed that the first Turkic people lived in a region extending from Central Asia to Siberia, with the majority of them living in China historically, establishing themselves after the 6th century BC. [PARAGRAPH:2]The earliest separate Turkic peoples appeared on the peripheries of the late Xiongnu Confederation about 200 BC (contemporaneous with the Chinese Han Dynasty) and probably lived as nomads for many years before establishing the Turkic Khaganate or G&#246;kt&#252;rk Empire in the 6th century. The first mention of Turks was in a Chinese text that mentioned trade between Turk tribes and the Sogdians along the Silk Road. The first recorded use of "Turk" as a political name appears as a 6th-century reference to the word pronounced in Modern Chinese as Tujue. The Ashina clan migrated from Li-jien (modern Zhelai Zhai) to the Rouran seeking inclusion in their confederacy and protection from the prevalent dynasty. The tribe were famed metalsmiths and were granted land near a mountain quarry that looked like a helmet, from which they were said to have gotten their name tujue. A century later, their power had increased such that they conquered the Rouran Khaganate and established the G&#246;k Empire. The Khanate retained elements of its original shamanistic religion, Tengriism, although it received missionaries of Buddhist monks and practiced a syncretic religion. The G&#246;kt&#252;rks were the first Turkic people to write Old Turkic in a runic script, the Orkhon script. The Khanate was also the first state known as "Turk". It eventually collapsed due to a series of dynastic conflicts, but many states and peoples later used the name "Turk". [PARAGRAPH:2]The main migration of Turkic peoples and related groups occurred in medieval times in many waves, when they spread across most of Asia and into Europe and the Middle East. In the Volga region one group of Bulgars settled and mixed with local Volga Finns to become the Volga Bulgars in what is today Tatarstan. Other Bulgars settled in Southeastern Europe in the 7th and 8th centuries, and mixed with the Slavic population, adopting what eventually became the Slavic Bulgarian language. As these peoples founded states in the area between Mongolia and Transoxiana, they met Muslims, and most of them gradually adopted Islam. Small groups of Turkic people practice other religions, including Christians, Jews, Buddhists, and Zoroastrians. The Khazars, for example, converted to Judaism in the 8th or 9th century. Everywhere, Turkic groups mixed with the local populations to varying degrees.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the Muslim world, Turkic dynasties emerged as rulers of great and powerful empires.  In the 11th century, Oghuz and other tribes captured and dominated various countries under the leadership of the Seljuk dynasty and eventually captured the territories of the Abbasid dynasty and the Byzantine Empire, forming the Great Seljuk Empire; The Ottoman Empire (1299鈥?922), that came to dominate not only the Middle East, but also even southeastern Europe, parts of southwestern Russia, and northern Africa; The Timurid Empire were a Turkic Uzbek-based empire founded in the late 14th century by Timurlane, a descendant of Genghis Khan; The Mughal Empire, a Turkic-founded Indian empire that, at its greatest territorial extent, ruled most of the South Asia from the early 16th to the early 18th centuries; And the Iranian Safavid and Afsharid dynasties, who formed what has come to be the modern Iran state.[PARAGRAPH:2]The dominance of the nomads ended in the 16th century, as firearms allowed settled peoples to gain control of the region. Russia, China, and other powers expanded into the region and captured the bulk of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century.[PARAGRAPH:2]vFrom the mid-19th century until almost the end of the 20th century, most of Central Asia was part of the Russian Empire (and later the Soviet Union). After the collapse of the Russian Empire living either in the Soviet Union or (after a short-lived First East Turkestan Republic) in the Chinese Republic.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1991, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, five Turkic states gained their independence. These were Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Other Turkic regions such as Tatarstan, Tuva, and Yakutia remained in the Russian Federation. Chinese Turkestan remained part of the People's Republic of China. [PARAGRAPH:2]Immediately after the independence of the Turkic states, Turkey began seeking diplomatic relations with them. Over time, political meetings between the Turkic countries increased and led to the establishment of T&#220;RKSOY in 1993 and later the Turkic Council in 2009.</English>

		<English>[TAB]At the risk of dramatic oversimplification - a stock exchange is an organization which allows "brokers" to buy and sell "stocks" and "bonds." A stock represents part ownership in a company, and a bond is a loan to a company, which the company guarantees to repay with interest. If the company does well, the investors make money; if the company does poorly (or fails entirely) the investors lose money.[PARAGRAPH:1]The primary benefit of a stock exchange to society is that it allows companies to concentrate a large amount of wealth to accomplish something that no individual (or perhaps government) would be able to afford. In the nineteenth century, for example, construction of the United States' railroad network was in large part financed by individuals who purchased shares of railroad companies. Earlier in history, the great British and Dutch trading companies were similarly financed.[PARAGRAPH:1]For a long period of history, the English city of London was the financial center of the world. The London Stock Exchange is one of the largest exchanges in the world, as well as one of the oldest. Though officially founded in 1801, it can trace its origins to the late seventeenth century, when - the brokers having been expelled from the Royal Exchange for rowdiness - buying and selling stocks took place in London coffee houses.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Benin Empire or Edo Empire was a large pre-colonial African state of modern Nigeria. According to one traditional account, the original people and founders of the Benin Empire, the Bini, were initially ruled by the Ogisos (Kings of the Sky). The city of Ibinu (later called Benin City) was founded in 1180 AD. About 36 known Ogiso are accounted for as rulers of the empire. [PARAGRAPH:2]Oranmiyan, the son of Ekaladerhan aka Oduduwa, agreed to go to Benin. He spent some years in Benin and came back to Ife after his wife gave birth to a son named Eweka. Eweka I became the first Oba of Benin. In 1440, Oba Ewuare (Ewuare the Great) came to power and turned the city-state into an empire. Around 1470, he named the new state Edo. The Oba had become the paramount power within the region. Oba Ewuare, the first Golden Age Oba, is credited with turning Benin City into a military fortress protected by moats and walls. It was from this bastion that he launched his military campaigns and began the expansion of the kingdom from the Edo-speaking heartlands. The lands of Idah, Owo, Akure all came under the central authority of the Edo Empire.[PARAGRAPH:2]At its maximum extent the empire is claimed by the Edos to have extended from Onitsha in the east, through the forested southwestern region of Nigeria and into the present-day nation of Ghana. The Ga peoples of Ghana trace their ancestry to the ancient Kingdom of Benin. The state developed an advanced artistic culture especially in its famous artifacts of bronze, iron and ivory. These include bronze wall plaques and life-sized bronze heads of the Obas of Benin. The most common artifact is based on Queen Idia, porpularly called the FESTAC mask. Benin grew increasingly rich during the 16th and 17th centuries on the slave trade with Europe; slaves from enemy states of the interior were sold, and carried to the Americas in Dutch and Portuguese ships. The Bight of Benin's shore soon came to be known as the "Slave Coast."[PARAGRAPH:2]The city and empire of Benin declined after 1700, but revived in the 19th century with the development of the trade in palm oil, enslaved captives, and textiles. To preserve Benin's independence, bit by bit the Oba banned the export of goods from Benin, until the trade was exclusively in palm oil.[PARAGRAPH:2]Benin resisted signing a protectorate treaty with Great Britain through most of the 1880s and 1890s. However, after the slaying of eight British representatives in Benin territory, a 'Punitive Expedition' was launched in 1897, in which a British force, under the command of Admiral Sir Harry Rawson, conquered and burned the city, destroying much of the country's treasured art and dispersing nearly all that remained. The portrait figures, busts, and groups created in iron, carved ivory, and especially in brass (conventionally called the "Benin Bronzes") made in Benin are now displayed in museums around the world.</English>

Its authority is difficult to question, since no modern figure can easily claim the right to change what was established by the ancestors. This can be a great weakness of the system when times change, but so long as the basic mechanisms of existence remain stable, the tradition-oriented culture gains a strong sense of its own values, and feels powerful ties to the legacy of its own ancestors. As society became more settled, existing customs grew formalized and expanded.

		<English>[TAB]The use of money as a unit of account predates history. Government control of money is documented in the ancient Egyptian economy (2750鈥?150 BC). The Egyptians measured the value of goods with a central unit called shat. As many other currencies, the shat was linked to gold. The value of a shat in terms of goods was defined by government administrations. Other cultures in Asia Minor later materialised their currencies in the form of gold and silver coins.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the medieval and the early modern period a network of professional banks was established in Southern and Central Europe. The institutes built a new tier in the financial economy. The monetary system was still controlled by government institutions, mainly through the coinage prerogative. Banks, however, could use book money to create deposits for their customers. Thus, they had the possibility to issue, lend and transfer money autonomously without direct governmental control.[PARAGRAPH:2]In order to consolidate the monetary system, a network of public exchange banks was established at the beginning of the 17th century in main European trade centres. The Amsterdam Wisselbank was founded as a first institute in 1609. Further exchange banks were located in Hamburg, Venice and Nuremberg. The institutes offered a public infrastructure for cashless international payments. They aimed to increase the efficiency of international trade and to safeguard monetary stability. The exchange banks thus fulfilled comparable functions to modern central banks. The institutes even issued their own (book) currency, called Mark Banco.</English>

Cavour died only three months after the declaration of a united Kingdom of Italy, and thus did not live to see Venetia or Rome included in the kingdom.[PARAGRAPH:2]Cavour, as he is usually called, put forth several economic reforms in his home province of Piedmont in his earlier years, and founded the political newspaper Il Risorgimento. After being elected to the Chamber of Deputies, he quickly rose in rank through the Piedmontese government, coming to dominate the Chamber of Deputies through a union of left-center and right-center politicians. After a large rail system expansion program, Cavour became prime minister in 1852. As prime minister, Cavour successfully negotiated Piedmont's way through the Crimean War, Second Italian War of Independence, and Garibaldi's expeditions, managing to maneuver Piedmont diplomatically to become a new great power in Europe, controlling a nearly united Italy that was five times as large as Piedmont had been before he came to power.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_SPECIALIST_PRIEST_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]A priest is a person authorized to perform the sacred rituals of a religion, especially as a mediatory agent between humans and one or more deities. They also have the authority or power to administer religious rites; in particular, rites of sacrifice to, and propitiation of, a deity or deities. Their office or position is the priesthood, a term which also may apply to such persons collectively.[PARAGRAPH:1]Priests have existed since the earliest of times and in the simplest societies, most likely as a result of agricultural surplus and consequent social stratification. The necessity to read sacred texts and keep temple or church records helped foster literacy in many early societies. Priests exist in many religions today, such as all or some branches of Judaism, Christianity, Shintoism, Hinduism. They are generally regarded as having positive contact with the deity or deities of the religion to which they subscribe, often interpreting the meaning of events and performing the rituals of the religion. There is no common definition of the duties of priesthood between faiths; but generally it includes mediating the relationship between one's congregation, worshippers, and other members of the religious body, and its deity or deities, and administering religious rituals and rites. These often include blessing worshipers with prayers of joy at marriages, after a birth, and at consecrations, teaching the wisdom and dogma of the faith at any regular worship service, and mediating and easing the experience of grief and death at funerals - maintaining a spiritual connection to the afterlife in faiths where such a concept exists. Administering religious building grounds and office affairs and papers, including any religious library or collection of sacred texts, is also commonly a responsibility - for example, the modern term for clerical duties in a secular office refers originally to the duties of a cleric. The question of which religions have a "priest" depends on how the titles of leaders are used or translated into English. In some cases, leaders are more like those that other believers will often turn for advice on spiritual matters, and less of a "person authorized to perform the sacred rituals" For example, clergy in Roman Catholicism and Orthodox Christianity are priests, but in Protestant Christianity they are typically minister and pastor. The terms priest and priestess are sufficiently generic that they may be used in an anthropological sense to describe the religious mediators of an unknown or otherwise unspecified religion.[PARAGRAPH:1]In many religions, being a priest or priestess is a full-time position, ruling out any other career. Many Christian priests and pastors choose or are mandated to dedicate themselves to their churches and receive their living directly from their churches. In other cases it is a part-time role. For example in the early history of Iceland the chieftains were titled go&#240;i, a word meaning "priest". As seen in the saga of Hrafnkell Freysgo&#240;i, however, being a priest consisted merely of offering periodic sacrifices to the Norse gods and goddesses; it was not a full-time role, nor did it involve ordination.[PARAGRAPH:1]In some religions, being a priest or priestess is by human election or human choice. In Judaism the priesthood is inherited in familial lines.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Among the technically more advanced sedentary civilizations on both edges of the Eurasian landmass, a different kind of cavalry seems to have emerged shortly after 1000 BC. Reliefs from great Assyrian palaces show horsemen, clad in armour and armed with spear or lance or sword, who were used in combination with other troops such as light and heavy infantry. The function of these cataphracts (from the Greek word for 'armour') was not to engage in long-distance combat but to launch massed shock action, first against the enemy cataphracts and then, having gained the field, against the enemy foot. The fact that ancient cavalry apparently did not possess the stirrup has often led modern historians to question the mounted soldier's effectiveness. They argue that, since riders held on only by pressure of their knees, their ability to deliver shock was limited by the fear of falling off their mounts. This argument fails to note that, particularly in Hellenistic times and again in late Roman ones, cavalry forces did indeed play an important, often decisive, part in countless battles. Still, it is true that never during classical antiquity did cavalry succeed in replacing the formations of heavy infantry that remained the backbone of every army.</English>

		<English>[H1]Ramesses II the Great[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Pharaoh of Egyptian Empire[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1302 - 1213 BC[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Also known as "Ramesses the Great," Ramesses was an Egyptian pharaoh of the Nineteenth Dynasty. He was the third king in his dynasty, the son of King Seti I and Queen Tuya. Ramesses was born around 1302 BC and ruled from approximately 1279 to 1213 BC. Among Ramesses' many wives, the most famous was Nefertari, who was his principal wife for over twenty years and was later deified and worshipped as a goddess. Ramesses seems to have enjoyed all of the benefits of his position as pharaoh, and he fathered about 100 children during his long rule. One of them, the Pharaoh Merneptah, became his successor.[PARAGRAPH:2]Ramesses was most famous for leading several military campaigns along the eastern Mediterranean coast. On one of these expeditions into modern-day Israel and Lebanon, Ramesses ran into the Hittite army of King Muwatallis. At the Battle of Kadesh in 1274, the two sides fought for control of the territory comprising modern Syria. It was probably the largest chariot battle ever fought, with some 5000 chariots engaged on both sides. The battle was largely inconclusive, and both sides claimed victory. However Ramesses lost more men than Muwatallis, so the Hittites probably got the best of the Egyptians. Two sides continued to struggle against one another for decades to come until they signed a peace treaty in 1258 BC - this is the first peace treaty ever recorded in history. At the other end of his domains, Ramesses also campaigned extensively south of the First Cataract of the Nile in Nubia, winning additional land for Egypt.[PARAGRAPH:2]Today Ramesses is one of the best-known Egyptian pharaohs, primarily because he had so many monuments and statues of himself erected. The renowned archaeological complex of Abu Simbel - one of the best-preserved sites from ancient Egypt - was built on his orders. Ramesses' mummy was discovered in 1881; it was moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, where it is still proudly displayed to the public today. (His 3000-year old body is in surprisingly good shape.)[PARAGRAPH:2]Ramesses is often popularly identified as the pharaoh who confronted Moses in the Bible. However, Ramesses lived to the age of 90 after a long reign of 66 years; he did not drown in the Red Sea; and there is no mention in the records of a slave revolt during his reign - so this seems quite unlikely.</English>

These inscriptions are dispersed throughout the areas of modern-day Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan and represent the first tangible evidence of Buddhism. The edicts describe in detail the first wide expansion of Buddhism through the sponsorship of one of the most powerful kings of Indian history. According to the edicts, the extent of Buddhist proselytism during this period reached as far as the Mediterranean, and many Buddhist monuments were created.[PARAGRAPH:1]These inscriptions proclaim Ashoka's beliefs in the Buddhist concept of dharma and his efforts to develop the dharma throughout his kingdom. Although Buddhism and the Buddha are mentioned, the edicts focus on social and moral precepts, rather than specific religious practices or the philosophical dimension of Buddhism.[PARAGRAPH:1]In these inscriptions, Ashoka refers to himself as "Beloved of the Gods" and "King Priya-darshi". The identification of King Priya-darshi with Ashoka was confirmed by an inscription discovered in 1837. The inscriptions found in the eastern part of India were written in the Magadhi language, using the Brahmi script. In the western part of India, the language used is closer to Sanskrit, using the Kharoshthi script, one extract of Edict 13 in the Greek language, and one bilingual edict written in Greek and Aramaic.These edicts were decodified by British archeologist and historian James Prinsep.[PARAGRAPH:1]The inscriptions revolve around a few recurring themes: Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism, the description of his efforts to spread Buddhism, his moral and religious precepts, and his social and animal welfare program.</English>

The traditional halite mining was described by Alexander von Humboldt during his visit to Zipaquira in 1801. He depicts this deposit as bigger than the main halite mines of the time, such as those in Spain, Switzerland, Poland and the County of Tyrol with a calculated resource estimation of one million cubic meters. Von Humboldt also criticized the excavation techniques as being unpractical for future exploitation, recommending drift mining instead, since the halite tunnels don't require beams, lowering the costs.[PARAGRAPH:2]Years before the underground church was built (around 1932), the miners had carved a sanctuary, as a place for their daily prayers asking for protection to the saints before starting to work. In 1950, the construction of a bigger project had begun: the Salt Cathedral which was inaugurated on August 15, 1954 and dedicated to Our Lady of Rosary, Patron saint of miners. It was compound of three naves and a monumental cross. Part of the galleries were actually carved by the ancient Muisca. However, as the church was carved inside an active mine, structural problems and safety concerns led the authorities to shut it in September 1992. This construction cost of the original church was over 285 million U.S. dollars. The building had 120 m length, 5.500 m&#178; surface and 22 m height. It had six main columns, and a maximum capacity of 8000 people.[PARAGRAPH:2]The main nave included the monumental cross, which was illuminated from the base up, projecting a large cross-shaped shadow in the ceiling. The right nave included the Stations of the Cross icons and the Rosary chapel, with the Virgin of Rosary Icon (sculpted by Daniel Rodriguez Moreno and later transported to the new cathedral).

		<English>[TAB]The gray wolf (Canis lupus), also known as the timber wolf, true wolf or western wolf is a canid native to the wilderness and remote areas of North America, Eurasia, and North Africa. It is the largest extant member of its family, with males averaging 43-45 kg (95-99 lb), and females 36-38.5 kg (79-85 lb). Like the red wolf, it is distinguished from other Canis species by its larger size and less pointed features, particularly on the ears and muzzle. Its winter fur is long and bushy, and predominantly a mottled gray in color, although nearly pure white, red, or brown to black also occur.[PARAGRAPH:1]The gray wolf is the most specialised member of the genus Canis, as demonstrated by its morphological adaptations to hunting large prey, its more gregarious nature, and its highly advanced expressive behavior. It is nonetheless closely related enough to smaller Canis species, such as the eastern wolf, coyote and golden jackal to produce fertile hybrids. It is the only species of Canis to have a range encompassing both the Old and New Worlds, and originated in Eurasia during the Pleistocene, colonizing North America on at least three separate occasions during the Rancholabrean. It is a social animal, travelling in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair, accompanied by the pair's adult offspring. The gray wolf is typically an apex predator throughout its range, with only humans and tigers posing a serious threat to it. It feeds primarily on large ungulates, though it also eats smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage.[PARAGRAPH:1]The gray wolf is one of the world's best known and well researched animals, with probably more books written about it than any other wildlife species. It has a long history of association with humans, having been despised and hunted in most pastoral communities due to its attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some agrarian and hunter-gatherer societies. It is the sole ancestor of the dog, which genetic and paleontological records indicate was first domesticated in Europe 18,800-32,100 years ago by hunter-gatherers. Although the fear of wolves is pervasive in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. Non-rabid wolves have attacked and killed people, mainly children, but this is unusual, as wolves are relatively few, live away from people, and have been taught to fear humans by hunters and shepherds.[PARAGRAPH:1]The gray wolf was once one of the world's most widely distributed mammals, living throughout the northern hemisphere north of 15&#176;N latitude in North America and 12&#176;N in India. However, deliberate human persecution has reduced the species' range to about one third, due to livestock predation and fear over attacks on humans. The species is now extinct in much of Western Europe, in Mexico and much of the USA. In modern times, the gray wolf occurs mostly in wilderness and remote areas, particularly in Canada, Alaska and northern USA, Europe, and Asia from about 75&#176;N to 12&#176;N. Wolf population declines have been arrested since the 1970s, and have fostered recolonization and reintroduction in parts of its former range, due to legal protection, changes in land-use and rural human population shifts to cities. Competition with humans for livestock and game species, concerns over the danger posed by wolves to people, and habitat fragmentation pose a continued threat to the species. Despite these threats, because of the gray wolf's relatively widespread range and stable population, it is classified as Least Concern by the IUCN.</English>

Hernando Cortes conquered Mexico during the period 1519-21 and founded a Spanish colony that lasted nearly 300 years.[PARAGRAPH:2]Independence from Spain was proclaimed by Father Miguel Hidalgo on September 16, 1810. Father Hidalgo's declaration of national independence, known in Mexico as the "Grito de Dolores", launched a decade long struggle for independence from Spain. Prominent figures in Mexico's war for independence were Father Jose Maria Morelos; Gen. Augustin de Iturbide, who defeated the Spaniards and ruled as Mexican emperor from 1822-23; and Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana, who went on to dominate Mexican politics from 1833 to 1855. An 1821 treaty recognized Mexican independence from Spain and called for a constitutional monarchy. The planned monarchy failed; a republic was proclaimed in December 1822 and established in 1824.[PARAGRAPH:2]Throughout the rest of the 19th century, Mexico's government and economy were shaped by contentious debates among liberals and conservatives, republicans and monarchists, federalists and those who favored centralized government. During the two presidential terms of Benito Juarez (1858-71), Mexico experimented with modern democratic and economic reforms. President Juarez' terms of office, and Mexico's early experience with democracy, were interrupted by the Habsburg monarchy's rule of Mexico (1864-67), and was followed by the authoritarian government of Gen. Porfirio Diaz, who was president during most of the period between 1877 and 1911.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mexico's severe social and economic problems erupted in a revolution that lasted from 1910-20 and gave rise to the 1917 constitution. Prominent leaders in this period (some of whom were rivals for power) were Francisco Madero, Venustiano Carranza, Pancho Villa, Alvaro Obregon, Victoriano Huerta, and Emiliano Zapata. The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), formed in 1929 under a different name, emerged from the chaos of revolution as a vehicle for keeping political competition among a coalition of interests in peaceful channels. For 71 years, Mexico's national government was controlled by the PRI, which won every presidential race and most gubernatorial races until the July 2000 presidential election of Vicente Fox Quesada of the National Action Party (PAN).</English>

Located in the northern part of the continent, it extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean. At 9.98 million square kilometres in total, Canada is the world's second-largest country by total area. Its common border with the United States is the world's longest land border shared by the same two countries. The land that is now Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various Aboriginal peoples. Beginning in the late 15th century, British and French colonies were established on the region's Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various conflicts, the United Kingdom gained and lost North American territories until left, in the late 18th century, with what mostly comprises Canada today. Pursuant to the British North America Act, on July 1, 1867 three colonies joined to form the autonomous federal dominion of Canada. This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the new self-governing dominion. In 1931, Britain granted Canada full independence in most matters with the Statute of Westminster 1931. The Canada Act 1982 severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament. Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state. Canada is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. The country is officially bilingual at the federal level. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries, with a population of approximately 35 million as of December 2012.

		<English>[TAB]The Kingdom of Spain is located in the extreme southwest of the European continent, and occupies approximately 85 percent of the Iberian Peninsula.  Spain is bordered on the west by Portugal, in the northeast by France, and by the great wall of the Pyrenees Mountains.  The Iberian Peninsula that the Spanish inhabited was occupied by various other civilizations, including the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Visigoths, and Muslims, and Spain is now associated with having a very rich, eclectic culture as a result.[PARAGRAPH:2]The development of Christian society and culture in the first 300 years following Islamic conquest in Spain was slow, but major changes occurred for the Spanish in the 12th and 13th centuries.  The population grew, communication with northern Europe intensified, commerce and urban life gained in importance, and the kingdoms of Castile, Aragon, Navarre, and Portugal emerged as the governing bodies of the Iberian Peninsula.  These kingdoms reached the frontiers that they would keep, with minimum amount of alteration, until the end of the Middle Ages, when Isabella I became Queen of Castile.[PARAGRAPH:2]Isabella began participating in the royal court at the age of 13; and when Portugal, Aragon, and France offered their marriage candidates, she favored Ferdinand of Aragon.  Isabella ascended to the throne as Queen of Castile to rule sensibly and with a prudent political program.  Her unification of the states of the Iberian Peninsula into a single entity, the maintenance and control over the Straits of Gibraltar, policy of expansion into Muslim North Africa, reform of Spanish Catholicism, and support for the exploration and expansion of the unknown were evidence of her wisdom and capabilities as Queen. In 1492 Columbus, with the blessing and financial backing of Isabella, sought a route to the legendary rich markets of China and Japan. He instead discovered what would become known as "The New World", the present day Americas.  This voyage gave way to a new golden age of expeditions and conquest, as the Americas contained gold, a valuable resource that Spain happened to be desperately bereft of at the time.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Spanish explorer Hernando Cortes came to the New World with the sole purpose of seeking out new frontiers and riches in the unknown.  Men like Cortes became known as Conquistadores, adventurers who undertook their expeditions in the vast landmasses of the Americas at their own expense, risking their lives without aid from the Spanish royalty.  Their conquests included campaigns in Guatemala, Peru, Cuzco, Columbia, Chile, the Bay of Honduras, and as far as the Pacific coastal regions. The Conquistadors, however, were given to fighting and searching for gold, and were swiftly replaced by administrators and settlers from Spain who governed in their place.[PARAGRAPH:2]The twin forces of disease and conquest combined to devastate the indigenous peoples of the Americas, allowing the Spaniards to carve out an enormous empire comprising most of North and South America. Many of the Spanish colonies proved to yield fabulous wealth in the form of gold and sugar, but working conditions were so harsh that large numbers of Africans were brought across the Atlantic as slaves to replace the Indians who had died working on the plantations. These lucrative operations inevitably became high-profile targets of pirates and other raiders who were endorsed by European powers such as England. The Monarchy of Spain endeavored to retaliate by building an armada of warships that was dubbed "The Invincible Armada". The armada was a collection of over 130 naval warships and transport-ships, which contained approximately 8,000 seamen and 19,000 soldiers. King Philip II (1556-98) directed this armada to invade England when the various and frequent raids on Spanish commerce in the Caribbean became intolerable.  England's success in repelling the Spanish fleet saved England and the Netherlands from potential consolidation into the Spanish Empire, but despite the Armada's defeat, Spain remained temporarily the strongest land power in Europe.[PARAGRAPH:2]Thereafter, Spain declined in power quickly; the enormous influx of gold and silver from the Americas debased the Spanish currency, and most of the nation's military might was wasted in the quagmire of religious conflict known as the Thirty Years War (1618-48). By the beginning of the 18th century, Spain had become somewhat marginal in international politics, even though it continued to hold vast territories in the Americas. Spain's period of imperial power and exploration left a legacy that consisted of 18 nations in Latin American, the Spanish presence in the Phillipines, and the ever-growing Spanish-speaking population in the United States today. It is also due to the work of Jesuit missionaries from Spain that hundreds of millions of people in Latin America practice Roman Catholicism to this day. In 1975 Spain transitioned into a constitutional monarchy by way of a democratic constitution and is now recognized for its eclectic culture as well as for the glory and mystique that it once possessed in its youth.</English>

In 1912, de Gaulle graduated from Saint-Cyr, the premier military academy in France. Two years later the precocious, young soldier found himself in the midst of the carnage of World War I. Captured by the Germans after the Battle of Verdun in 1916, de Gaulle was held for nearly two years before being released when the War to End All Wars finally came to a close.[PARAGRAPH:2]After a brief stint fighting with the Polish during the Polish-Soviet War, de Gaulle returned to France and began publishing numerous papers on the state of modern warfare. His most prophetic, "The Army of the Future," published in 1934, argued that the static defenses of the Maginot Line, France's key protection against another German invasion, would not last in the face of a modern mobile assault.[PARAGRAPH:2]His words would go unheeded.[PARAGRAPH:2]With the German invasion of France and the capitulation of French leadership, de Gaulle escaped to Great Britain, firm in his belief that while the government had folded, France was not defeated. From England, de Gaulle broadcast a message of resistance back to his homeland, stating "France has lost a battle, but France has not lost the war." Leaving Great Britain, de Gaulle traveled towards the French colonies in Africa, now under the control of the Nazi-sympathizing Vichy government. Creating the new base for his "Free French" movement in the Congo, de Gaulle won a series of key victories against the Vichy and German forces, steadily increasing his strength and renown.[PARAGRAPH:2]When France was finally liberated by the Allies, the Free French forces were there to take control of the country. De Gaulle became the interim Prime Minister as the Fourth Republic was created, but disagreements with the nascent government ended in de Gaulle's resignation.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1958, economic struggles and political infighting in the Fourth Republic drew de Gaulle back into power and would mark the beginning of the French Fifth Republic. With a strong hand, de Gaulle began a period of driven, some would say bullheaded, modernization and redirection of the French state. Ushering in France's nuclear age and breaking ties with the problematic French colony of Algeria, de Gaulle ensured that France would remain among the premier nations of the world.</English>

Pasture in a wider sense additionally includes rangelands, other unenclosed pastoral systems, and land types used by wild animals for grazing or browsing.</English>

		<English>[H1]Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prime Minister of Italy[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1883- 1945 AD[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini was an Italian politician, journalist, and leader of the National Fascist Party, ruling the country as Prime Minister from 1922 until he was ousted in 1943. He ruled constitutionally until 1925, when he dropped all pretense of democracy and set up a legal dictatorship. Known as Il Duce ("the leader"), Mussolini was the founder of fascism.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1912 Mussolini was the leading member of the National Directorate of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI). Prior to 1914 he was a keen supporter of the Socialist International, starting the series of meetings in Switzerland that organised the communist revolutions and insurrections that swept through Europe from 1917. Mussolini was expelled from the PSI due to his opposition to the party's stance on neutrality in World War I. Mussolini denounced the PSI, and later founded the fascist movement. Following the March on Rome in October 1922 he became the youngest Prime Minister in Italian history until the appointment of Matteo Renzi in February 2014. After destroying all political opposition through his secret police and outlawing labor strikes, Mussolini and his fascist followers consolidated their power through a series of laws that transformed the nation into a one-party dictatorship. Within five years he had established dictatorial authority by both legal and extraordinary means, aspiring to create a totalitarian state. Mussolini remained in power until he was deposed by King Victor Emmanuel III in 1943. A few months later, he became the leader of the Italian Social Republic, a German client regime in northern Italy; he held this post until his death in 1945.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mussolini sought to delay a major war in Europe until at least 1942. Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, starting World War II. On 10 June 1940, with the Fall of France imminent, Mussolini officially entered the war on the side of Germany, though he was aware that Italy did not have the military capacity to carry out a long war with the United Kingdom Mussolini believed that after the imminent French armistice, Italy could gain territorial concessions from France and then he could concentrate his forces on a major offensive in Egypt, where British and Commonwealth forces were outnumbered by Italian forces. However the UK refused to accept German proposals for a peace that would involve accepting Germany's victories in Eastern and Western Europe, plans for an invasion of the UK did not proceed, and the war continued. In the summer of 1941 Mussolini sent Italian forces to participate in the invasion of the Soviet Union, and war with the United States followed in December.[PARAGRAPH:2]On 24 July 1943, soon after the start of the Allied invasion of Italy, the Grand Council of Fascism voted against him, and the King had him arrested the following day. On 12 September 1943, Mussolini was rescued from prison in the Gran Sasso raid by German special forces. In late April 1945, with total defeat looming, Mussolini attempted to escape north, only to be quickly captured and summarily executed near Lake Como by Italian Communists. His body was then taken to Milan where it was hung upside down at a service station for public viewing and to provide confirmation of his demise.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_CIVIC_SECULARISM_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]Secularism is the principle of separation between government institutions and the persons mandated to represent the State from religious institutions and religious dignitaries. In one sense, secularism may assert the right to be free from religious rule and teachings, and the right to freedom from governmental imposition of religion upon the people within a state that is neutral on matters of belief. In another sense, it refers to the view that human activities and decisions, especially political ones, should be unbiased by religious influence. Some scholars are now arguing that the very idea of secularism will change.[PARAGRAPH:2]Secularism draws its intellectual roots from Greek and Roman philosophers such as Marcus Aurelius and Epicurus; medieval Muslim polymaths such as Ibn Rushd; Enlightenment thinkers such as Denis Diderot, Voltaire, Baruch Spinoza, John Locke, James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and Thomas Paine; and more recent freethinkers, agnostics, and atheists such as Robert Ingersoll and Bertrand Russell.[PARAGRAPH:2]The purposes and arguments in support of secularism vary widely. In European laicism, it has been argued that secularism is a movement toward modernization, and away from traditional religious values (also known as secularization). This type of secularism, on a social or philosophical level, has often occurred while maintaining an official state church or other state support of religion. In the United States, some argue that state secularism has served to a greater extent to protect religion and the religious from governmental interference, while secularism on a social level is less prevalent. Within countries as well, differing political movements support secularism for varying reasons.</English>

		<Chinese>政教分离是政府机构和被授权代表国家的人与宗教机构和宗教要人分离的原则。从某种意义上说，世俗主义可能主张在一个对信仰问题持中立态度的国家内，有权不受宗教统治和教义的影响，有权不受政府强加给人民的宗教的影响。从另一个意义上讲，它指的是这样一种观点，即人类的活动和决定，特别是政治活动和决定，应不受宗教影响。一些学者现在主张世俗主义的观念会改变。[段落：2 ]世俗主义从希腊和罗马哲学家那里汲取其知识根源，如Marcus Aurelius和伊壁鸠鲁；中世纪穆斯林的多数学如伊本·路世德；启蒙思想家如德尼斯·狄德罗、伏尔泰、Baruch Spinoza、约翰·洛克、詹姆斯·麦迪逊。托马斯·杰斐逊和托马斯·潘恩；还有更多的自由思想家、不可知论者和无神论者，如Robert Ingersoll和Bertrand Russell。[段落：2 ]支持世俗主义的目的和论点有很大的不同。在欧洲的世俗主义中，有人认为世俗主义是一种走向现代化的运动，并且远离传统的宗教价值观（也称为世俗化）。这种世俗主义，在社会或哲学层面上，往往是在维持官方教会或其他国家对宗教的支持时发生的。在美国，有人认为，国家世俗主义在很大程度上起到了保护宗教和宗教不受政府干预的作用，而社会层面的世俗主义则不那么普遍。在各国内部，不同的政治运动出于不同的原因支持世俗主义。</Chinese>

His father was ruler of "Ch'in," one of the seven dominant states in China; upon his death Cheng ascended the throne at the age of 13. However, rule was actually exercised by his prime minister until, at 22, Cheng assumed control of state affairs and stripped the minister of his powers.[PARAGRAPH:2]Chen quickly instituted a series of agricultural and military reforms that greatly strengthened Ch'in. In the next 17 years, Chen defeated the other six great powers, uniting the divided lands for the first time. He then gave himself the title "Qin Shi Huang," which means "First Emperor."[PARAGRAPH:2]The emperor was politically astute, using bribery, blackmail and espionage as much as force of arms to achieve his goals. He ruthlessly suppressed Confucianism, which set limits on the Emperor's power, going so far as to burn all books relating to China's past.[PARAGRAPH:2]While emperor, Qin Shi Huang established a centralized administration and constructed a network of roads and canals, he also fought against the steppe peoples from the northern desert, and began construction of the Great Wall of China to set limits to their incursions.

Chosen by the Emperor Ly Hue Tong as his successor at the age of only six, Ly Chieu Hoang ruled the country under the total influence of Tran Thu Do and the Tran clan in the royal court. It was Tran Thu Do who arranged the marriage between the 6-year old empress regnant and his 7-year-old nephew Tran Canh and ultimately indeed did overthrow the Ly Dynasty to found the Tran Dynasty in 1225. After the coronation of Tran Canh, now Tran Thai Tong, Ly Chieu Hoang was downgraded to Empress Chieu Thanh and finally to Princess Chieu Thanh when she was forced by Tran Thu Do to give up the position of empress consort to her elder sister Princess Thuan Thien. Afterwards, she was married one more time to general Le Ph谩禄楼 Tran, with whom she had two children. Ly Chieu Hoang&apos;s complicated and tragic life was a fine example of the turbulent time of the Late Ly and Early Tran Dynasty in history of Vietnam.[NEWLINE]Ly Chieu Hoang was born in September of Lunar calendar 1218 as Ly Phat Kim, subsequently changed to Ly Thien Hinh, second child of the Emperor Ly Hue Tong and the Empress Tran Thi Dung. She had an elder sister, Princess Thuan Thien, who was born in 1216 and later married to Prince Ph谩禄楼ng Can (Vietnamese: Ph谩禄楼ng Can vu脝隆ng) Tran Lieu, Ly Phat Kim herself was entitled as Princess Chieu Thanh, the only available successor for the throne.[PARAGRAPH:2]Having been mentally ill for a long time, the Emperor Ly Hue Tong ultimately decided to cede the throne of the Ly Dynasty to crown princess Ly Chieu Hoang in October of Lunar calendar, 1224. Ly Chieu Hoang thus became the only empress regnant in history of Vietnam. This decision of Ly Hue Tong was considered by the historian Ngo Si Lien as the crucial factor leading to the collapse of the Ly Dynasty, because if he had chosen a capable member of the royal family instead of his young princess, the situation for the Dynasty could have been different.[PARAGRAPH:2]Succeeding to the throne at the age of only six, Ly Chieu Hoang ruled under the total influence of Commander of Royal Guard Tran Thu Do and other members of the Tran clan, who began to take over power in the royal court during the reign of Ly Hue Tong. Even the Empress Regnant&apos;s servants were chosen by Tran Thu Do, so that trusted servants of Ly Chieu Hoang all came from the Tran clan, such as Tran Bat Cap, Tran Thiem or Tran Thu Do&apos;s 7-year-old nephew Tran Canh. When Tran Canh informed Tran Thu Do that the Empress Regnant seemed to have affection towards him, the leader of the Tran clan immediately decided to use this chance to carry out his plot of overthrowing the Ly Dynasty and founding his clan&apos;s own dynasty. Firstly Tran Thu Do moved the whole Tran clan to the royal palace and arranged a secret marriage between Ly Chieu Hoang and Tran Canh there, without the appearance of any mandarin or member of the Ly royal family. The royal marriage took place in October or November 1225, when Ly Chieu Hoang and Tran Canh were both only 7 years old. After that, he announced the fait accompli to the royal court and made Ly Chieu Hoang cede the throne to her newly married husband for the reason that she was not capable for the position, so Tran Canh was chosen as her successor. Hence, the 216-year reign of the Ly Dynasty was ended and the new Tran Dynasty was created on the first day of the twelfth lunar month, 1225 (December 31, 1225). The only era name of the Empress Regnant was Thien Chuong Huu Dao.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the coronation of Tran Canh, now Tran Thai Tong, Ly Chieu Hoang was downgraded to Empress Consort Chieu Thanh (Chieu Thanh hoang hau) in January 1226. Although Tran Th谩禄芦a, father of the new emperor, acted as Regent in the royal court, it was the grand chancellor Tran Thu Do who held absolute power in the court and decided both military and civil matters of the country. Still afraid that the newly founded rule of the Tran Dynasty might be overthrown by its political opponents, Tran Thu Do continued to eliminate members of the Ly royal family by his ruthless method. The grand chancellor ordered Ly Chieu Hoang&apos;s father, Ly Hue Tong, to commit suicide on October 8 of Lunar calendar 1226 while married her mother Empress Tran Thi Dung, now Princess Thien Cuc. These actions of Tran Thu Do were criticized by Ngo Si Lien in his Dai Viet su k脙颅 toan thu as an inhumane decision, despite his initial motive of reinforcing the reign of Tran Thai Tong. Not satisfied with the death of Hue Tong, Tran Thu Do decided to kill off all members of the Ly royal family in August 1232 during the death anniversary of Ly emperors held in Thai Du谩禄聺ng, Hoa Lam (now Nam Truc, Nam Dinh). However, the authenticity of this event was challenged by the historian Ngo Si Lien because a member of the Ly clan was still appointed as general by Tran Anh Tong and there was no account of this event in Phan Phu Tien&apos;s historical record.[PARAGRAPH:2][NEWLINE]According to Dai Viet su k脙颅 toan thu, Empress Chieu Thanh could not bear a child for the Emperor for a while; this situation in the royal family worried grand chancellor Tran Thu Do because he had exploited the same situation involving the Emperor Ly Hue Tong to overthrow the Ly Dynasty. Therefore in 1237 Tran Thu Do decided to force Tran Lieu to give up his wife Princess Thuan Thien for the Emperor when she had already been pregnant with Tran Qu谩禄聭c Khang for three months. After the royal marriage, Thuan Thien was made the new empress of the Tran Dynasty while Chieu Thanh was downgraded to princess. In fury at losing his pregnant wife, Tran Lieu raised a revolt against the royal family; meanwhile Thai Tong felt awkward about the situation and decided to became a monk in Yen Tu Mountain. Eventually Tran Thu Do persuaded Thai Tong to return to the throne and Tran Lieu surrendered after judging that he could not prevail with his small force. All the soldiers who participated in this revolt were killed; Tran Thu Do even wanted to behead Tran Lieu but was stopped by Thai Tong. Vietnamese historians in feudal era such as Ngo Si Lien or Phan Phu Tien often criticized the decisions of Tran Thu Do and Tran Thai Tong in this situation and considered it the origin of the downfall of the Tran Dynasty afterwards during the reign of Tran D谩禄楼 Tong.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1258, Thai Tong decided to remarry Princess Chieu Thanh to the general Le Ph谩禄楼 Tran because he had an essential role in the victory of Dai Viet over the first Mongol invasion. This event was one more time criticized in historical books for the lack of moral code in marriage during the Early Tran period. Princess Chieu Thanh died in C谩禄聲 Phap in March 1278 at the age of 61. With the second husband Le Ph谩禄楼 Tran, she had two children, Marquis Le Tong and Princess 谩禄sng Th谩禄楼y Le Khue.[NEWLINE]Because of her role in the collapse of the Ly Dynasty, Ly Chieu Hoang was not worshipped along with her ancestors, eight previous emperors of the Ly Dynasty, at the Ly Bat De Temple (Bac Ninh); her cult was only placed in a nearby shrine which was smaller than the main temple. From the beginning of 2009, this shrine was renovated on a large scale on the occasion of the millenary anniversary of Hanoi which was founded by the Ly Dynasty. This restoration was criticized by several newspapers and residents because almost all architectural features at the shrine were demolished and totally rebuilt despite the fact that the shrine was already credited as a national historical relic of Vietnam. Responding to the criticism, the official responsible for this renovation stated that the temple was actually not as ancient as others thought and they had to rebuild from the foundation because the shrine was in very bad shape and reconstruction was necessary.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Sumerian Empire was founded along the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, in modern day Iraq, in roughly 3000 BC. Sumeria was the world's first civilization and created the world's first historians through the invention of cuneiform, the original written language.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Sumerian people were organized into a series of carefully irrigated city-states, each with its own ruler and local deities. The surplus of wheat grown from the verdant fertility of the Tigris and Euphrates allowed the Sumerians to create an exceptional urban civilization. Never numbering more than a dozen or so, the cities of Sumeria were major centers of commerce, culture and defense, and the Sumerians were the first truly metropolitan population. In fact, the Sumerian creation myth states that first there was nothing; then there was a city - Eridu.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sumerian cities were seas of sun-cooked brick, rushing irrigation ditches and mountainous ziggurats (the Sumerian temples to the gods). Facing near-constant warfare, each city was defined by a series of intimidating walls and well-placed canals. Indeed, the Sumerians are the first people known to employ a professional army, necessary to fight the perpetual skirmishes that characterized Sumerian daily life.[PARAGRAPH:1]Unity in Sumeria was only established at the end of a spear. The first Sumerian King to lay claim over a number of cities was Eannatum of Lagash. Initiating a campaign against the city of Umma (Lagash's ancient rival) over a border dispute, Eannatum followed up his victory by sweeping over and conquering the remainder of Sumeria. An uprising within Umma would later shatter this new empire, but a mutual treaty would again bring peace to Sumeria.[PARAGRAPH:1]However, the Sumerians were not alone in the Fertile Crescent. Their competitors included the Akkadians, a Semetic people to the North. In 2334 BC, Sargon, a highly skilled military strategist, was born in Akkadia. Upon reaching maturity, Sargon would found his own dynasty - the Akkadians - bringing all the peoples of the Fertile Crescent, including the Sumerians, under his rule.[PARAGRAPH:1]In roughly 2250 BC, a new people, the Gutians, thundered into the Fertile Crescent, deposing the Akkadians and establishing themselves as the new rulers of the land. But the rigors of invasion severely weakened the new overlords of Mesopotamia, allowing the long-dominated Sumerians the chance for rebellion. With the rise of a new leader, Utu-khegal, the Sumerians threw off their Gutian overlords and reestablished the supremacy of Sumerian culture throughout the Fertile Crescent.[PARAGRAPH:1]Under Ur-Nammu, a successor of Utu-khegal, order was restored in the fractured state, and the period of The Third Dynasty of Ur began. Ur-Nammu was a reformer and builder as well as a warrior, and he created roads and walls throughout his new empire. This golden age would last until 2004 BC, when internal feuding fractured the Sumerian nation decisively.[PARAGRAPH:1]The story of Sumeria comes to us through the many cuneiform tablets that have been discovered. Unfortunately, many of these tablets aren't especially evocative: tireless record-keepers, the Sumerians would just as often record the season's flock of sheep as the reign of ancient kings. Several tablets, though, have been of a religious nature and have provided great insights into the foundation of Judeo-Christian beliefs. Tales of a great flood abound in Sumerian myth. Man, they said, was formed from clay.[PARAGRAPH:1]Although the first great empire vanished from history, Sumerian culture would survive to influence the next great civilization to spring from the Tigris-Euphrates Valley - Babylon.</English>

Apparently, grains were some of the earliest crops cultivated. Grains are incredibly useful foodstuffs; they can be ground into flour and turned into bread, they can be fed to livestock and, perhaps most importantly, they can be stored for months without spoiling.[PARAGRAPH:2]Over time a number of important tools were invented to aid in cultivation and preparation of grains. The sickle was an early innovation; it allowed the grain to be harvested far quicker than by hand. Hand mills and mortar and pestles were created to grind the finished product, and pots to store it. As man learned about fertilization and irrigation, it became possible to get consistently larger yields, which lessoned the chances of famine and increased the numbers that could be fed from each field.</English>

Soon, recruitment also began among Polish and Lithuanian citizens. The Hussars proved vital to Poland because they were more maneuverable than the previously used lancers. But the reign of King Stefan Batory, the hussars formed the bulk of the Polish and Lithuanian cavalry. Over many years, hussars in Hungary became heavier. When Stefan Batory was elected king of Poland, he reorganized the Polish-Lithuanian hussars of his Royal Guard making them a heavy formation, and equipping lancers as their main weapon. These Polish 'heavy' hussars were known in their homeland as "husaria"[PARAGRAPH:1]With the Battle of Lubiszew in 1577, the "Golden Age" of the hussar began. Until the Battle of Vienna, Polish-Lithuanian hussars rarely lost in battle. Throughout many battles the Polish-Lithuanian hussars would prove to be an important factor against overwhelming odds.[PARAGRAPH:1]The primary battle tactic of the Polish-Lithuanian hussars was the charge. They also tended to repeat the charge until the enemy formation broke. The hussars fought with a long lance, a szabla, one or two pistols, and a carbine or arquebus, known in Polish as a "bandolet". Polish hussars were also famous for the wings they wore on their backs. According to some theories, they were designed to foil attacks by Tatar lassos, another theory being that the vibrating of feathers made a strange sound that frightened enemy horses. However, experiments carried out by re-enactors and movie-makers since the 1970s and more recently by Polish historians in 2001 contradict such ideas. Possibly the wings were worn only during parades and not during combat, but this explanation is also disputed.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Ethiopia is believed by many historians to be the birthplace of the human race. Lucy, a 3.2 million year old human skeleton, was discovered in Ethiopia's Afar Depression. However, beyond Lucy, there is little evidence to suggest (one way or another) that Ethiopia was settled until roughly the eighth century BC, when it is theorized that Jewish settlers fleeing Egypt, Sudan, and southern Arabia settled there.[PARAGRAPH:2]The first recorded government in Ethiopia was the Kingdom of Axum in the first century AD. Information on this kingdom is scarce; its founder remains unknown. But under Axum rule, Ethiopia became the first Christian nation in Africa. In roughly 330 AD, Frumentius, a Greek from Tyre, was consecrated the first bishop of Ethiopia by Saint Athanasius. Frumentius spread Christianity in Ethiopia through the construction of churches on land given to him by the Axum emperor. Although Christianity did not become a widespread religion in the region until much later, Frumentius can be considered the originator of Christianity in Ethiopia.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although Ethiopia had traditionally been the target for Muslim raids in the region, it was not until 1528 that a full scale invasion was successful. Under the leadership of Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi, Muslim forces swept through Ethiopia, routing the emperor's forces and sending him into hiding. Unable to re-secure his homeland with Ethiopian forces alone, Emperor Lebna Dengel Dawit II petitioned the Portuguese to assist defeating the invaders. In 1541 the Portuguese deployed an army of 400 musketeers to assist the emperor, and while these forces were defeated at the Battle of Wofla, the Muslims were ultimately forced to retreat when their leader was killed the following year at the Battle of Wayna Daga.[PARAGRAPH:2]Ethiopia had been wracked by a series of internal conflicts throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth century. While not splintering the nation, these conflicts eroded the empire's central power until the feuding families were ultimately defeated by Tewodros II, who ruled Ethiopia between 1855 and 1868. Despite a prestigious military career, Tewodros II committed an egregious political faux pas when, in 1867, he imprisoned several British nationals after Queen Victoria of the England failed to answer a letter he had sent to her. The British swiftly sent an army to rescue the British citizens, and upon the Ethiopian army's defeat, Tewdros II committed suicide.[PARAGRAPH:2]Soon after, in 1870, the Italians, who had bought the Ethiopian costal city of Eritrea from a local Sultan, claimed that the Treaty of Wuchale (1889), an agreement between Italy and Ethiopia on the official boundaries between Ethiopia and Eritera, granted them sovereignty over all of Ethiopia, though in reality it only specified a very small portion of Northern Ethiopia near Eritrea. The Italians sent an army to conquer Ethiopia, but were repelled by Emperor Menelek II at the Battle of Adowa. After their defeat, the Italians signed the Treaty of Addis Ababa (1896) which recognized Ethiopia as an independent state. As it turned out, the Italians would be back.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1936 the Italians once again invaded and occupied Ethiopia, this time under the fascist dictatorship of Mussolini, forcing the emperor to flee to England. The Italians were eventually defeated in 1941 by combined British and Ethiopian forces.[PARAGRAPH:2]Perhaps the most influential Ethiopian Emperor of the modern era was Haile Selassie I. Ruling from 1930 until his death in 1974 (with the exception of the brief Italian occupation), Selassie made great strides in modernizing his nation. New tax programs were implemented and the constitution was revised under his rule.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1972, an enormous drought hit Ethiopia resulting in the deaths of over 200,000 citizens. Local rulers conspired to keep this information from Emperor Selassie, and when the information was finally revealed, the government's credibility with the common citizenry was seriously undermined. Combined with a major economic recession, the chaos within the government due to the drought provided the opportunity for officers within the Ethiopian military to stage a coup and take over the government. Haile Selassie I died on August 27th, 1975 when it is believed that he was suffocated in his sleep while imprisoned by the military government.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 2005 Ethiopia underwent its second multiparty election. Despite claims of corrupted vote counting, much of the international community saw this election as a positive step for Ethiopia's future.</English>

		<English>[H1]Musa I[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Mansa of Mali[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] c.1280 - 1337 AD[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Musa was the grandson of Sundiata Keita, the Muslim founder of the Mali Empire, which existed on the Mandinka plateau in West Africa from the 14th to the 17th centuries. At the time Mali was the source of over half of the world's gold, and Musa was fabulously wealthy. During his famous hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca) in 1324, Musa gave away so much gold in Cairo that the price of gold there was depressed for the next twenty years. He gave away so much treasure, in fact, that he had to borrow money to pay for his return trip. Legend has it that Musa was accompanied on his journey by a huge retinue and honor guard, not to mention 60,000 porters to carry the supplies.[PARAGRAPH:2]Called "Musa the Magnificent," Mansa was celebrated for his enlightenment and piety. He added the important towns of Timbuktu and Gao to his kingdom. Upon reaching the throne, Musa became a feverish Muslim, and he built countless mosques across the country and made Islam the state religion, though he did not persecute other religions in his country.[PARAGRAPH:2]Musa encouraged trade between Mali and the world beyond, using his country's vast resources of kola nuts, ivory, salt, and gold to attain goods from three continents. A believer in knowledge, Musa made the city of Timbuktu into a center of learning and craftsmanship, and Sankore University was one of the great schools in the Muslim world. Students came from all over to receive a free education there.[PARAGRAPH:2]Musa died in 1337, after ruling Mali for twenty-five years. A contemporary historian said of Masa Musa, that, of all of the leaders in West Africa, he was, "the most powerful, the richest, the most fortunate, and the most feared by his enemies and the most able to do good for those around him."</English>

		<English>[TAB]A constabulary is a standing body of law enforcement officials charged with keeping the peace, arresting criminals, and otherwise acting as a civilian enforcement arm of the law.[PARAGRAPH:2]The idea of civilian law enforcement as a neutral body of servants of the state, as opposed to being the personal minions of individual rulers or magistrates, is tied into the concept of constitutional law. The law authorizes the creation of officials whose office is, in itself, to enforce those laws, and these enforcers are to be loyal not to the ruler, but to the law itself. When this principle is properly enforced and established, it has tremendous social benefits. The "social capital" and public trust of a society are strengthened when people of all classes and races can be confident that the police are enforcing the laws fairly. Doing business on an honest, reliable basis becomes easier and safer. Private citizens have less to fear in their daily lives.[PARAGRAPH:2]Efficient, orderly, enforcement of the rule of law is one of the cornerstones of civilization in the modern developed world.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Garden Grove Community Church was founded in 1955 by Robert H. Schuller and his wife Arvella. An affiliate of the Reformed Church in America, the church first held services in space rented from the Orange Drive-In Theatre.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1961, the congregation moved to a new sanctuary designed by architect Richard Neutra. In 1968, the congregation completed the Tower of Hope to provide office and classroom space but continued growth led to the need for a new facility. Schuller envisioned a unique facility with walls made of glass and commissioned architect Philip Johnson. The design was an outgrowth of Johnson's reexamination of German expressionist architect Hermann Finsterlin. Construction of the Crystal Cathedral began in 1977 and was completed in 1980, built at a cost of $18 million. The signature rectangular panes of glass comprising the building are not bolted to the structure; they are glued to it using a silicone-based glue. This and other measures are intended to allow the building to withstand an earthquake of magnitude 8.0. The building was constructed using over 10,000 rectangular panes of glass.[PARAGRAPH:2]Upon moving from the old Neutra sanctuary to the new Johnson sanctuary in 1981, the congregation changed its name to the "Crystal Cathedral" - an alliteration derived from the appearance of the building. In fact, the building was neither made of crystal nor intended to be a true cathedral - that is, a church that houses a bishop's official seat (cathedra) - by that congregation. The congregation added the Prayer Spire in 1990.</English>

He was the first monarch of the House of Vasa, an influential noble family which came to be the royal house of Sweden for much of the 16th and 17th centuries. Gustav I was elected regent in 1521 after leading a rebellion against Christian II of Denmark, the leader of the Kalmar Union who controlled most of Sweden at the time.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gustav was an enigmatic person who has been referred to as both a liberator of the country and as a tyrannical ruler, which has made him the subject of many books. When he came to power in 1523, he was largely unknown, and he became the ruler of a still divided country without a central government. Though not as famous as most of his continental contemporaries, he became the first truly autocratic native Swedish sovereign and was a skilled propagandist and bureaucrat who laid the foundations for a more efficient centralized government. During his reign Protestantism was introduced in the country. In traditional Swedish history he has been labelled the founder of modern Sweden, and the "father of the nation". Gustav liked to compare himself to Moses, whom he believed to have also liberated his people and established a state. As a person, Gustav was known for ruthless methods and a bad temperament, but he also loved music, and had a certain sly wit.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gustav was born in Lindholmen, Sweden to a noble family, and was educated at the University of Uppsala. As a young man he entered the army, and from 1518 to 1519 he fought against Christian II, king of Denmark, who had invaded Sweden to regain the throne that the Danes had lost in 1501. Gustav was taken hostage but managed to escape. He was still a fugitive when he heard that Christian had massacred his father and other nationalist Swedish nobles in the Stockholm bloodbath of 1520. From 1521 to 1523, with an army of peasants, Gustav led a successful revolt and drove the Danes out of Sweden. His victory resulted in the dissolution of the Union of Kalmar, which in 1397 had placed Sweden and Norway under the Danish crown. Gustav was administrator of the kingdom from 1521 to 1523, when the Riksdag, or national assembly, elected him king. He strengthened his political hold and restored order by introducing the Reformation into Sweden. The Roman Catholic church had supported Christian II, and Gustav used this as an excuse for stripping the church of political power and confiscating its property. In 1527 he made Swedish bishops subject to royal power, and in 1529 he proclaimed Lutheranism the state religion. He joined with Norway in 1537 to defeat the German city of L&#220;beck, making Sweden economically independent of the Hanseatic League, a federation of German cities to enhance their commercial interests. Gustav created a strongly united state by introducing a sound financial administration, strengthening manufacturing, trade, and agricultural interests, and increasing the military forces. In 1544 he made the Swedish crown hereditary through his line, the house of Vasa. On his death, Gustav was succeeded by his son, Eric XIV.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gustav's heritage has been disputed. In 19th century Swedish history a folklore developed wherein Gustav was supposed to have had all kinds of adventures when he liberated Sweden from the Danes. The memory of Gustav has been honored greatly, resulting in embroidered history books, commemorative coins, and the annual ski event Vasaloppet (the largest ski event in the world with 15,000 participants). The city of Vaasa in Finland was named after the royal house of Vasa in 1606. Gustav is currently portrayed on the 1000 kronor note. Today most of these stories are considered to have no other foundation than legend and skilful propaganda by Gustav himself during his time. Gustav has been regarded by some as a power-hungry man who wished to control everything: the Church, the economy, the army and all foreign affairs. But in doing this, he also did manage to unite Sweden, a country that previously had no standardized language, and where individual provinces held a strong regional power. He also laid the foundation for Sweden's professional army that was to make Sweden into a regional superpower in the 17th century.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Byzantine Empire, centered around the city of Constantinople, was the successor to the Roman Empire. At its height, the Byzantine Empire reached from Persia to Spain, controlling nearly all the territory that felt the lap of the Mediterranean's warm waters.[PARAGRAPH:2]When the Byzantine Empire began and the Roman Empire ceased is a point of much contention. Some historians place the beginning of the Byzantine Empire in 300 AD, when Constantine I moved the capital of the Roman Empire from Rome to a city called Byzantium (later know as Constantinople). Others place the birth of the Byzantine Empire at the end of the reign of Theodosius I, who at his death split the Roman Empire into the Western Empire, ruled from Rome, and the Eastern Empire, ruled from Constantinople.[PARAGRAPH:2]Regardless of historic debate, after the sacking of Rome in 476 AD, the Byzantine Empire was to become the foremost European nation in art, trade and stability - although not necessarily all at once. Taking the throne in 527 AD, Justinian I extended the grip of the Byzantine Empire from Constantinople to the furthest coasts of the Mediterranean Sea. However the Empire would not be able to enjoy the benefits of such territorial expansions for long, as Justinian's successor, Justin II, would begin a trend of placating the various enemies of the Empire - the Sassanid Persians, the Bulgars, and the Arabs, newly organized under Mohammed - with territory in exchange for peace.[PARAGRAPH:2]Territorial losses would continue to weaken the Byzantines until a new lineage of emperors, known as the Macedonian Emperors, arose to invigorate the Empire once again. Basil I founded the Macedonian line in 869. Under the Macedonians, the Byzantine Empire once again began to reach outwards, solidifying its hold on much of the territory neighboring Constantinople. Art flourished in their roughly two centuries of rule, as did the Greek Orthodox Church.[PARAGRAPH:2]The new millennium would be a painful one for Byzantium. Relations between the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church had been deteriorating for many years, and the conflict came to a head with the Great Schism (1054), which finally split the two religions. Militarily, increased assaults by the Seljuk Turks culminated in a resounding defeat for the Empire at the Battle of Manzikert, the Empire losing much of its freshly-gained holdings.[PARAGRAPH:2]But once again, the rise of a powerful new dynasty reversed the Empire's decline. This new dynasty, the Comnenius, sent the call to Western Europe for aid in fighting the Seljuk Turks. Pope Urban II, seeing a chance to reconquer the Holy Lands of Antioch and Jerusalem, as well as halt the squabbling of the European Kings, spread the word for the First Crusade.[PARAGRAPH:2]Through the Crusaders' efforts, the Byzantine Empire regained a portion of its lost territory. But the holy warriors of Western Europe became difficult to control, often threatening to assault the very Empire that had requested their aid. John II and Manuel I, the two most prestigious of the Comnenius emperors, held off the Crusaders and safeguarded the empire from a host of external foes, while ushering in a new era of Byzantine artistic and economic prowess.[PARAGRAPH:2]Manuel I Comnenius was the last great emperor of the Byzantines and the last Comneni. The Angeloi dynasty, successors to the Comneni, proved unable to halt the Empire's slow collapse. In 1204, the knights of the Fourth Crusade, summoned by a disposed Angeloi prince, sacked Constantinople and split the Byzantine Empire into three smaller kingdoms. Nicaea, one of these ex-Byzantine states, recaptured Constantinople years later, but all hopes of reviving the Byzantine Empire would be ended with the capture of the city by the Ottoman leader Mehmed II in 1461.</English>

		<English>[H1]Ragnar Lodbrok[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Sweden and Denmark[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 9th Century AD[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Ragnar Lodbrok was a semi-legendary king of Sweden and Denmark who ruled sometime in the eighth or ninth centuries. The exact dates surrounding Ragnar's life are unknown, but most likely he was a Viking warlord who went on raids from approximately 835 to 865 AD. Ragnar is described as being part of the Yngling Dynasty of Swedish kings, descended from the Swedish king Sigurd Ring. The word Lodbrok means "hairy breeches" and refers to a pair of trousers his wife made for him out of animal skins. Ragnar was a pagan and believed that he was a direct descendant of the Norse god Odin. Christian churches and monasteries were among his favorite targets for attack.[PARAGRAPH:2]Many of the details surrounding Ragnar's life are known only through legend, and must be viewed with a certain amount of skepticism, but he appears to have been a remarkable individual. Ragnar spent most of his life as a pirate and raider. He would demand a huge ransom from his victims for their lives, and then return a short while later to extort another payment in exchange for leaving. Based upon the number of Vikings who agreed to follow him, Ragnar must have been a successful and charismatic leader. In 845 Ragnar led a force of 120 ships carrying 5000 Vikings to the mouth of the Seine River, and from there to the city of Paris. The city was captured easily, and the Frankish king Charles the Bald (a grandson of Charlemagne) agreed to pay an enormous sum of money to Ragnar for sparing the city from destruction. According to Viking sources, Ragnar demanded a whopping 7000 pounds of silver, which he got. Though he honored the deal and left Paris (more or less) intact, that did not stop Ragnar from pillaging his way across the rest of northern France, destroying whatever crossed his path.[PARAGRAPH:2]After having his way in France, in 865 Ragnar turned north and landed in England. He came aground in the northern kingdom of Northumbria, which was ruled at the time by King Aelle II. Ragnar met Aelle in battle the same year, and for the first and only time in his life Ragnar was defeated. He was also captured and thrown into a pit full of poisonous snakes.[PARAGRAPH:2]As he was dying, Ragnar is said to have exclaimed, "How the little pigs would grunt if they knew the situation of the old boar!" This was a reference to his sons in Sweden, and it would have been well if Aelle II had paid his words closer attention, for in 866, the following year, Ragnar's fourth son Ivar the Boneless led a major Viking expedition to England seeking revenge. Ivar met King Aelle in battle, defeated him, and subjected him in turn to an agonizing death.[PARAGRAPH:2]Whether or not it was launched to exact revenge for Ragnar's death, the Viking invasion had serious consequences for England - the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia, and East Anglia were all attacked and destroyed. The descendents of Ragnar were at last stopped in 871, when they were finally defeated by Alfred the Great of Wessex.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Qing dynasty, also known as the Qing Empire, officially the Great Qing, was the last imperial dynasty of China, established in 1636 and ruling China from 1644 to 1912. It was preceded by the Ming dynasty and succeeded by the Republic of China. The Qing multi-cultural empire lasted almost three centuries and formed the territorial base for the modern Chinese state. It was the fourth largest empire in world history.[PARAGRAPH:2]The dynasty was founded by the Jurchen Aisin Gioro clan in Manchuria. In the late sixteenth century, Nurhaci, originally a Ming vassal, began organizing "Banners", military-social units that included Jurchen, Han Chinese, and Mongol elements. Nurhaci formed the Jurchen clans into a unified entity, which he renamed as the Manchus. By 1636, his son Hong Taiji began driving Ming forces out of Liaodong and declared a new dynasty, the Qing. In 1644, peasant rebels led by Li Zicheng conquered the Ming capital, Beijing. Rather than serve them, Ming general Wu Sangui made an alliance with the Manchus and opened the Shanhai Pass to the Banner Armies led by the regent Prince Dorgon, who defeated the rebels and seized the capital. Resistance from the Southern Ming and the Revolt of the Three Feudatories led by Wu Sangui extended the conquest of China proper for nearly four decades and was not completed until 1683 under the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1661-1722). The Ten Great Campaigns of the Qianlong Emperor from the 1750s to the 1790s extended Qing control into Inner Asia. The early rulers maintained their Manchu ways, and while their title was Emperor, they used "Bogd khaan" to the Mongols and they were patrons of Tibetan Buddhism. They governed using Confucian styles and institutions of bureaucratic government and retained the imperial examinations to recruit Han Chinese to work under or in parallel with Manchus. They also adapted the ideals of the tributary system in dealing with neighboring territories.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the Qianlong reign (1735-96) the dynasty reached its apogee, but then began its initial decline in prosperity and imperial control. The population rose to some 400 millions, but taxes and government revenues were fixed at a low rate, virtually guaranteeing eventual fiscal crisis. Corruption set in, rebels tested government legitimacy, and ruling elites failed to change their mindsets in the face of changes in the world system. Following the Opium War, European powers imposed unequal treaties, free trade, extraterritoriality and treaty ports under foreign control. The Taiping Rebellion (1850-64) and the Dungan Revolt (1862-77) in Central Asia led to the deaths of some 20 million people, most of them due to famines caused by war. In spite of these disasters, in the Tongzhi Restoration of the 1860s, Han Chinese elites rallied to the defense of the Confucian order and the Qing rulers. The initial gains in the Self-Strengthening Movement were destroyed in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1895, in which the Qing lost its influence over Korea and the possession of Taiwan. New Armies were organized, but the ambitious Hundred Days' Reform of 1898 was turned back in a coup by Empress Dowager Cixi, a conservative leader. When the Scramble for Concessions by foreign powers triggered the violently anti-foreign "Boxers", the foreign powers invaded China, Cixi declared war on them, leading to defeat and the flight of the Imperial Court to Xi'an.[PARAGRAPH:2]After agreeing to sign the Boxer Protocol the government then initiated unprecedented fiscal and administrative reforms, including elections, a new legal code, and abolition of the examination system. Sun Yat-sen and other revolutionaries competed with reformist monarchists such as Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao to transform the Qing empire into a modern nation. After the deaths of Cixi and the Guangxu Emperor in 1908, the hardline Manchu court alienated reformers and local elites alike by obstructing social reform. The Wuchang Uprising on October 11, 1911, led to the Xinhai Revolution. General Yuan Shikai negotiated the abdication of Puyi, the last emperor, on February 12, 1912. The Qing empire was briefly restored on July 1, 1917, before it was once again overthrown 12 days later.</English>

The peoples of Kham have endured a tumultuous past, their sovereignty often encroached upon and marginalized by both Tibetans to the West and the Han Chinese to the East.[PARAGRAPH:1]Kham was never controlled by a single king, but most of the chieftains revered the Dalai Lamas and often made contact with the Lhasa government. Kham was a patchwork of two dozen or more kingdoms, tribes, and chiefdoms that were constantly at war with each other. Since the collapse of the Tibetan Empire in the mid-9th century, the peoples of Kham had aggressively maintained their independence from invading nations. Local chieftains ruled their respective territories with hereditary titles bestowed by the Tibetan government. Chieftains were able to rule with a large degree of independence from both China and Tibet.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1717, Dzungar tribes of Mongolia invaded Tibet, and a period of internal strife and civil war followed. The Kangxi emperor sent armies into the area for 20 years, and local leaders were forced to pledge their allegiance to the Qing Empire. In 1724, the regions of Amdo and Kham were made into the province of Kokonor, with parts of Eastern Kham incorporated into neighboring Chinese provinces.[PARAGRAPH:1]In the early 19th century, Gombo Namgye raised a rebellion in Nyarong, an area of Eastern Kham. He is reported to have taken control of Eastern Tibet, excepting Amdo. Residents of Derge and the Hor States appealed to both Lhasa and the Manchu government for help against Namgye. China was unable to take action, but Tibetan authorities sent an army in 1863, and defeated Namgye in 1865. Tibet then claimed Nyarong, Derge (or De-ge) and the Hor States north of Nyarong. This appears to have been accepted by the Manchu emperor.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tibetan control of the Batang region of Kham appears to have continued uncontested from an agreement made in 1726 until soon after the invasion of Tibet by Francis Younghusband in 1904, which alarmed the Qing rulers in China. They sent an imperial official to the region to begin reasserting Qing control, but the locals revolted and killed him. The Qing government in Beijing then appointed Zhao Erfeng, the Governor of Xining, "Army Commander of Tibet" to reintegrate Tibet into China. He was sent in 1905 (though other sources say this occurred in 1908) on a punitive expedition and began destroying many monasteries in Kham and Amdo and implementing a process of sinification of the region:[PARAGRAPH:1]"He abolished the powers of the Tibetan local leaders and appointed Chinese magistrates in their places. He introduced new laws that limited the number of lamas and deprived monasteries of their temporal power and inaugurated schemes for having the land cultivated by Chinese immigrants.[PARAGRAPH:1]Zhao's methods in eastern Tibet uncannily prefigured the Communist policies nearly half a century later. They were aimed at the extermination of the Tibetan clergy, the assimilation of territory and repopulation of the Tibetan plateaus with poor peasants from Sichuan. Like the later Chinese conquerors, Zhao's men looted and destroyed Tibetan monasteries, melted down religious images and tore up sacred texts to use to line the soles of their boots and, as the Communists were also to do later, Zhao Erfeng worked out a comprehensive scheme for the redevelopment of Tibet that covered military training reclamation work, secular education, trade and administration."[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1910, the Qing government sent a military expedition of its own to establish direct Chinese rule. They deposed the 13th Dalai Lama in an imperial edict and instigated a search for a new incarnation.. The Dalai Lama then fled to British India in February 1910. While in India, the Dalai Lama became a close friend of Charles Alfred Bell, a British diplomatic officer stationed in Sikkim and a critic of Great Britain's policies in the region. "By going in and then coming out again, we knocked the Tibetans down and left them for the first comer to kick," wrote Bell later. The situation was soon to change, however, as, after the fall of the Qing dynasty in October 1911, Zhao's soldiers mutinied and beheaded him.[PARAGRAPH:1]The 13th Dalai Lama fled to British India in February 1910. The same month, the Chinese Qing government issued a proclamation deposing the Dalai Lama and instigating the search for a new incarnation.[PARAGRAPH:1]The official position of the British Government was it would not intervene between China and Tibet and would only recognize the de facto government of China within Tibet at this time. Bell, in his history of Tibet, wrote of this time that "the Tibetans were abandoned to Chinese aggression, an aggression for which the British Military Expedition to Lhasa and subsequent retreat [and consequent power vacuum within Tibet) were primarily responsible". Later, Britain defined the Indo-Tibetan border at the 1914 Simla Accord with the McMahon Line. China's delegation refused to agree to the line and still claims the land India received from Tibet as South Tibet, although the McMahon line remains the de facto border.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1932, an agreement signed between Chinese warlord Liu Wenhui and Tibetan forces formalized the partition of Kham into two regions: Eastern Kham, which was administered by Chinese forces, and Western Kham, which was administered by Tibet. Eastern Kham subsequently became the actual area of control of China's Xikang province. The border between eastern and western Kham is the Yangtze River - Dri Chu in Tibetan and Jinsha Jiang, or Chang Jiang respectively, in Chinese.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1950, following the defeat of the Kuomintang rulers of China by communist forces in the Chinese Civil War, the People's Liberation Army entered western Kham. Western Kham was then set up as a separate Qamdo Territory , then merged into Tibet Autonomous Region in 1965. Meanwhile, Xikang province, comprising eastern Kham, was merged into Sichuan province in 1955. The border between Sichuan and Tibet Autonomous Region has remained the Yangtze River. The northernmost region of Kham, Yushu, has been a part of Qinghai province since the 18th century.</English>

He is reported to have taken control of Eastern Tibet, excepting Amdo. Residents of Derge and the Hor States appealed to both Lhasa and the Manchu government for help against Namgye. China was unable to take action, but Tibetan authorities sent an army in 1863, and defeated Namgye in 1865. Tibet then claimed Nyarong, Derge (or De-ge) and the Hor States north of Nyarong. This appears to have been accepted by the Manchu emperor.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tibetan control of the Batang region of Kham appears to have continued uncontested from an agreement made in 1726 until soon after the invasion of Tibet by Francis Younghusband in 1904, which alarmed the Qing rulers in China. They sent an imperial official to the region to begin reasserting Qing control, but the locals revolted and killed him. The Qing government in Beijing then appointed Zhao Erfeng, the Governor of Xining, "Army Commander of Tibet" to reintegrate Tibet into China. He was sent in 1905 (though other sources say this occurred in 1908) on a punitive expedition and began destroying many monasteries in Kham and Amdo and implementing a process of sinification of the region:[PARAGRAPH:1]"He abolished the powers of the Tibetan local leaders and appointed Chinese magistrates in their places. He introduced new laws that limited the number of lamas and deprived monasteries of their temporal power and inaugurated schemes for having the land cultivated by Chinese immigrants.[PARAGRAPH:1]Zhao's methods in eastern Tibet uncannily prefigured the Communist policies nearly half a century later. They were aimed at the extermination of the Tibetan clergy, the assimilation of territory and repopulation of the Tibetan plateaus with poor peasants from Sichuan. Like the later Chinese conquerors, Zhao's men looted and destroyed Tibetan monasteries, melted down religious images and tore up sacred texts to use to line the soles of their boots and, as the Communists were also to do later, Zhao Erfeng worked out a comprehensive scheme for the redevelopment of Tibet that covered military training reclamation work, secular education, trade and administration."[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1910, the Qing government sent a military expedition of its own to establish direct Chinese rule. They deposed the 13th Dalai Lama in an imperial edict and instigated a search for a new incarnation.. The Dalai Lama then fled to British India in February 1910. While in India, the Dalai Lama became a close friend of Charles Alfred Bell, a British diplomatic officer stationed in Sikkim and a critic of Great Britain's policies in the region. "By going in and then coming out again, we knocked the Tibetans down and left them for the first comer to kick," wrote Bell later. The situation was soon to change, however, as, after the fall of the Qing dynasty in October 1911, Zhao's soldiers mutinied and beheaded him.[PARAGRAPH:1]The 13th Dalai Lama fled to British India in February 1910. The same month, the Chinese Qing government issued a proclamation deposing the Dalai Lama and instigating the search for a new incarnation.[PARAGRAPH:1]The official position of the British Government was it would not intervene between China and Tibet and would only recognize the de facto government of China within Tibet at this time. Bell, in his history of Tibet, wrote of this time that "the Tibetans were abandoned to Chinese aggression, an aggression for which the British Military Expedition to Lhasa and subsequent retreat [and consequent power vacuum within Tibet) were primarily responsible". Later, Britain defined the Indo-Tibetan border at the 1914 Simla Accord with the McMahon Line. China's delegation refused to agree to the line and still claims the land India received from Tibet as South Tibet, although the McMahon line remains the de facto border.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1932, an agreement signed between Chinese warlord Liu Wenhui and Tibetan forces formalized the partition of Kham into two regions: Eastern Kham, which was administered by Chinese forces, and Western Kham, which was administered by Tibet. Eastern Kham subsequently became the actual area of control of China's Xikang province. The border between eastern and western Kham is the Yangtze River - Dri Chu in Tibetan and Jinsha Jiang, or Chang Jiang respectively, in Chinese.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1950, following the defeat of the Kuomintang rulers of China by communist forces in the Chinese Civil War, the People's Liberation Army entered western Kham. Western Kham was then set up as a separate Qamdo Territory , then merged into Tibet Autonomous Region in 1965. Meanwhile, Xikang province, comprising eastern Kham, was merged into Sichuan province in 1955. The border between Sichuan and Tibet Autonomous Region has remained the Yangtze River. The northernmost region of Kham, Yushu, has been a part of Qinghai province since the 18th century.</Chinese>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_RAILWAY_STATION_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]Rail transport is an energy-efficient and capital-intensive means of mechanized land transport and is a component of logistics. Along with various engineered components, rails constitute a large part of the permanent way. They provide smooth and hard surfaces on which the wheels of the train can roll with a minimum of friction. As an example, a typical modern wagon can hold up to 125 tons of freight on two four-wheel bogies/trucks (100 tons in UK). The contact area between each wheel and the rail is tiny, a strip no more than a few millimetres wide, which minimizes friction. In addition, the track distributes the weight of the train evenly, allowing significantly greater loads per axle / wheel than in road transport, leading to less wear and tear on the permanent way. This can save energy compared with other forms of transportation, such as road transport, which depends on the friction between rubber tires and the road. Trains also have a small frontal area in relation to the load they are carrying, which cuts down on forward air resistance and thus energy usage, although this does not necessarily reduce the effects of side winds. In all, under the right circumstances, a train needs 50-70 percent less energy to transport a given tonnage of freight (or given number of passengers) than does road transport.[PARAGRAPH:2]Due to these various benefits, rail transport is a major form of public transport in many countries. In Asia, for example, many millions use trains as regular transport in India, China, South Korea and Japan. It is also widespread in European countries. By comparison, intercity rail transport in the United States is relatively scarce outside the Northeast Corridor, although a number of major U.S. cities have heavily-used, local rail-based passenger transport systems or light rail or commuter rail operations.(Wikipedia)</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Celts were a group of Indo-Europeans who inhabited much of Central and Western Europe in the period between 1000 and 500 BC. While Celtic culture today is associated with Ireland, Scotland and Wales, the ancient Celts were spread out over a much larger distance. In addition to those locations, different groups of Celts were also present in Spain, France (Gaul), Hungary, and Bulgaria (Thrace). Although the Greeks and Romans considered the Celts to be barbarians, they possessed a sophisticated and unique culture.[PARAGRAPH:2]The ancient Celts of Gaul and Britain (who we know the most about) were divided into many tribes loosely based on kinship ties. Social structure was determined by a mixture of class standing within the tribe and one's place within the Celtic religion. Kings were elected to lead the tribes, and society was divided into the three groups: warriors, an intellectual class of druids and bards, and everyone else. Society was based around warfare, but to the Celts it was more of a sport than a battle to the death: raids were the norm, and pitched battles were rare.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Celts do not appear to have had any large cities, although there were many small towns and fortresses across the regions they controlled. Trade was rather primitive and mostly consisted of a barter economy, although in some coastal regions it was more developed. The Celts shared a common religion emphasizing sacred groves, the role of druids as priests and scholars, and the use of periodic sacrifices (which were occasionally human sacrifices). Celtic gods were named after natural phenomenon and they were quite numerous. Other Celtic practices included the removal of body hair (done to ensure cleanliness) and the taking of enemy heads as trophies in battle.[PARAGRAPH:2]The most notable event in the early history of the Celts was the sacking of the city of Rome in 390 BC under the great King Brennus. Although the victory was a military triumph and provided a large immediate gain to the Celts, the Romans would prove to have a very long memory, and over the years they would make their enemies pay dearly for it by methodically conquering all Celtic territory their mighty legions could reach.[PARAGRAPH:2]By 192 BC, the Romans had subjugated the last of the Celtic tribes in Italy, and they then began a program of colonization of southern Gaul on the Mediterranean coast. Under the great general Julius Caesar, the Romans conquered the entirety of Gaul and defeated a large revolt headed by Vercingetorix between 58 - 51 BC, removing the Celtic threat to the Imperial City once and for all. Under the Emperor Claudius, the Romans went on to invade and occupy Celtic Britain as well.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Celts remained under Roman rule for the next four centuries until the Germanic invasions of the fifth century AD destroyed the Roman Empire in the west. Although Celtic culture disappeared in many parts of Europe during those years of foreign occupation, it was preserved in Ireland and the western fringe of Britain. Over time the pagan Celtic culture would combine with Christianity to give rise to beautiful new forms of artwork and literature. Despite many attempts over the centuries to destroy it, the Celtic culture survives. In fact, today it enjoys a great deal of popularity and is even experiencing something of a revival.</English>

Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.[PARAGRAPH:1]Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails. While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous, and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo, the remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets.[PARAGRAPH:1]With the exception of courting individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically solitary animals. They are generally diurnal, but may be active during the night (nocturnal) or twilight (crepuscular), particularly around humans. Bears possess an excellent sense of smell and, despite their heavy build and awkward gait, are adept runners, climbers, and swimmers. In autumn, some bear species forage large amounts of fermented fruits, which affects their behaviour. Bears use shelters, such as caves and burrows, as their dens; most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period (up to 100 days) of sleep similar to hibernation.[PARAGRAPH:1]Bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur. With their tremendous physical presence and charisma, they play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various human societies. In modern times, the bears' existence has been pressured through the encroachment on their habitats and the illegal trade of bears and bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market. The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered, and even least concern species, such as the brown bear, are at risk of extirpation in certain countries.

		<Chinese>熊是熊科哺乳动物。熊被归类为犬科动物，或狗一样的食肉动物，与鳍足动物是他们的近亲。虽然现存的熊只有八种，但它们分布广泛，在北半球和南半球的许多栖息地都有分布。熊在北美洲、南美洲、欧洲和亚洲的大陆上发现。[段落：1 ]现代熊的共同特征包括体型大、腿粗、鼻子长、毛茸茸的毛发、有五个不可缩缩爪的短爪和短尾巴。虽然北极熊主要是食肉动物，而大熊猫几乎完全靠竹子喂养，其余六种动物都是杂食性的，有各种各样的饮食。[段落：1 ]，除了追求个体和母亲和它们的幼崽外，熊通常是独居动物。它们通常是白天活动的，但可能在夜间（夜间）或黄昏（黄昏）活动，特别是在人类周围。熊有很好的嗅觉，尽管它们的体形很重，步态很笨拙，但它们是熟练的跑步者、登山者和游泳者。在秋天，一些熊种会大量食用发酵的水果，这会影响它们的行为。熊使用洞穴，洞穴等洞穴作为栖息之地；大多数物种在冬季占据它们的巢穴，长达100天的睡眠时间（类似于冬眠）。[段：1 ]熊自史前时代就被捕猎以获取它们的肉和皮毛。他们以其巨大的身体存在和魅力，在艺术、神话和人类社会的其他文化方面发挥着突出的作用。在现代，熊的生存受到了压力，因为它们的栖息地受到侵犯，熊和熊的部分非法贸易，包括亚洲熊市。世界自然保护联盟（IUCN）将六种熊列为易受伤害或濒临灭绝的物种，即使是最不受关注的物种，如棕熊，在某些国家也有灭绝的危险。这些最受威胁人口的偷猎和国际贸易是被禁止的，但仍在继续。</Chinese>

		<English>[H1]Alp Arslan[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Sultan of the Seljuq Empire[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1029 - 1072 AD[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Alp Arslan was the third sultan of the Seljuk dynasty and great-grandson of Seljuk, the eponym of the dynasty. He assumed the name of Muhammad bin Da'ud Chaghri when he embraced Islam, and for his military prowess, personal valour, and fighting skills he obtained the surname Alp Arslan, which means "Warrior Lion" in Turkish.[PARAGRAPH:2]He succeeded his father Chagri Begh as governor of Khorasan in 1059. When his uncle Togrul died he was succeeded by Suleiman, Alp Arslan's brother. Alp Arslan and his uncle Kutalmish both contested this succession. Alp Arslan defeated Kutalmish for the throne and succeeded on 27 April 1064 as sultan of Great Seljuk, and thus became sole monarch of Persia from the river Oxus to the Tigris.[PARAGRAPH:2]In consolidating his empire and subduing contending factions he was ably assisted by Nizam ul-Mulk, his vizier, and one of the most eminent statesmen in early Muslim history. With peace and security established in his dominions, he convoked an assembly of the states and declared his son Malik Shah I his heir and successor. With the hope of capturing Caesarea Mazaca, the capital of Cappadocia, he placed himself at the head of the Turkish cavalry, crossed the Euphrates and entered and invaded the city. He then marched into Armenia and Georgia, which he conquered in 1064.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1068, en route to Syria, Alp Arslan invaded the Byzantine Empire. After three campaigns, the Turks were defeated and driven across the Euphrates. In 1071, while at Manzikert, north of Lake Van, Alp Arslan offered peace. The offer was rejected by Emperor Romanos IV and the two forces met in the Battle of Manzikert. The Cuman mercenaries among the Byzantine forces immediately defected to the Turkish side; and, seeing this, "the Western mercenaries rode off and took no part in the battle." The Byzantines were totally routed. Emperor Romanos IV was himself taken prisoner and conducted into the presence of Alp Arslan, who treated him with generosity, and, terms of peace having been agreed to, dismissed him, loaded with presents and respectfully attended by a military guard.[PARAGRAPH:2]Alp Arslan's victories changed the balance in near Asia completely in favour of the Seljuk Turks and Sunni Muslims. While the Byzantine Empire was to continue for nearly another four centuries, and the Crusades would contest the issue for some time, the victory at Manzikert signalled the beginning of Turkish ascendancy in Anatolia. Alp Arslan's conquest of Anatolia from the Byzantines is also seen as one of the pivotal precursors to the launch of the crusades.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Archaeological evidence suggests that civilisation in the region which now forms Burma is quite old. The oldest archaeological find was of cave paintings and a Holocene assemblage in a hunter-gatherer cave site in Padah Lin in Shan State. The Mon people are thought to be the earliest group to migrate into the lower Ayeyarwady valley, and by the mid-10th century BC were dominant in southern Burma.[NEWLINE][TAB]The Tibeto-Burman speaking Pyu arrived later in the 1st century BC, and established several city states - of which Sri Ksetra was the most powerful - in central Ayeyarwady valley. The Mon and Pyu kingdoms were an active overland trade route between India and China. The Pyu kingdoms entered a period of rapid decline in early 9th century AD when the powerful kingdom of Nanzhao invaded the Ayeyarwady valley several times.[NEWLINE][TAB]Tibeto-Burman speaking Burmans, or the Bamar, began migrating to the Ayeyarwady valley from Nanzhao kingdom starting in 7th century AD. Filling the power gap left by the Pyu, the Burmans established a small kingdom centred in Bagan in 849. But it was not until the reign of King Anawrahta that Pagan's influence expanded throughout much of present-day Burma. After Anawrahta's capture of the Mon capital of Thaton in 1057, the Burmans adopted Theravada Buddhism from the Mons. The Burmese script was created, based on the Mon script, during the reign of King Kyanzittha (1084-1112). Prosperous from trade, Bagan kings built many magnificent temples and pagodas throughout the country - many of which can still be seen today. Pagan's power slowly waned in 13th century. Kublai Khan's Mongol forces invaded northern Burma starting in 1277, and sacked Pagan city itself in 1287. Pagan's over two century reign of Ayeyarwady valley and its periphery was over. Pagodas and temples continue to exist in present-day Pagan, the capital of the Pagan Kingdom.[NEWLINE][TAB]The Mongols could not stay for long in the searing Ayeyarwady valley. But the Tai-Shan people from Yunnan who came down with the Mongols fanned out to the Ayeyarwady valley, Shan states, Laos, Siam and Assam, and became powerful players in Southeast Asia. The Pagan empire was irreparably broken up into several small kingdoms; This period was characterised by constant warfare inbetween them. [PARAGRAPH:2]In 1852, the British attacked a much weakened Burma during a Burmese palace power struggle. After the Second Anglo-Burmese War, which lasted 3 months, the British had captured the remaining coastal provinces: Ayeyarwady, Yangon and Bago, naming the territories as Lower Burma.[NEWLINE][TAB]King Mindon (1853-1878) founded Mandalay in 1859 and made it his capital. He skilfully navigated the growing threats posed by the competing interests of Britain and France. In the process, Mindon had to renounce Kayah (Karenni) states in 1875. His successor, King Thibaw (1878-1885), was largely ineffectual. In 1885, the British, alarmed by the French conquest of neighbouring Laos, occupied Upper Burma. The Third Anglo-Burmese War (1885) lasted a mere one month insofar as capturing the capital Mandalay was concerned. The Burmese royal family was exiled to Ratnagiri, India. British forces spent at least another four years pacifying the country - not only in the Burmese heartland but also in the Shan, Chin and Kachin hill areas. By some accounts, minor insurrections did not end until 1896.[NEWLINE][TAB]The landing of British forces in Mandalay after the last of the Anglo-Burmese Wars, which resulted in the abdication of the last Burmese monarch, King Thibaw Min.[NEWLINE][TAB]The British conquest of Burma began in 1824 in response to a Burmese attempt to invade India. By 1886, and after two further wars, Britain had incorporated the entire country into the British Raj. "The dawn of 1886 saw the addition of still further territory to that vast expanse which owns the sovereignty of the Queen. The King of Burmah having persistently violated treaties, war was declared against him, and the Burmese capital of Mandalay was entered by the British forces, under General Prendergast, on November 28th, 1885". Burma was administered as a province of British India until 1937 when it became a separate, self-governing colony. To stimulate trade and facilitate changes, the British brought in Indians and Chinese, who quickly displaced the Burmese in urban areas. To this day Rangoon and Mandalay have large ethnic Indian populations. Railways and schools were built, as well as a large number of prisons, including the infamous Insein Prison, then and now used for political prisoners. Burmese resentment was strong and was vented in violent riots that paralysed Yangon on occasion all the way until the 1930s.[NEWLINE][TAB]Much of the discontent was caused by a disrespect for Burmese culture and traditions, for example, what the British termed the Shoe Question: the colonisers' refusal to remove their shoes upon entering Buddhist temples or other holy places. In October 1919, Eindawya Pagoda in Mandalay was the scene of violence when tempers flared after scandalised Buddhist monks attempted to physically expel a group of shoe-wearing British visitors. The leader of the monks was later sentenced to life imprisonment for attempted murder. Such incidents inspired the Burmese resistance to use Buddhism as a rallying point for their cause. Buddhist monks became the vanguards of the independence movement, and many died while protesting. One monk-turned-martyr was U Wisara, who died in prison after a 166-day hunger strike to protest a rule that forbade him from wearing his Buddhist robes while imprisoned.[NEWLINE][TAB]A view of Fytche Square (now Mahabandula Garden) in downtown Rangoon, which was developed and expanded by the British to serve as Burma Proper's capital.[NEWLINE][TAB]Eric Blair (George Orwell) served in the Indian Imperial Police in Burma for five years; his experience yielded the novel Burmese Days (1934) and the essays "A Hanging" (1931) and "Shooting an Elephant" (1936). An earlier writer with the same expansive career path was Saki. During the colonial period, intermarriage between European male settlers and Burmese women, as well as between Anglo-Indians (who arrived with the British) and Burmese caused the birth of the Anglo-Burmese community. This influential community was to dominate the country during colonial rule and through the mid-1960s.[NEWLINE][TAB]On 1 April 1937, Burma became a separately administered territory, independent of the Indian administration. The vote for keeping Burma in India, or as a separate colony "khwe-yay-twe-yay" divided the populace, and laid the groundwork for the insurgencies to come after independence. In the 1940s, the Thirty Comrades, commanded by Aung San, founded the Burma Independence Army. The Thirty Comrades received training in Japan.[NEWLINE][TAB]During World War II, Burma became a major front-line in the Southeast Asian Theatre. The British administration collapsed ahead of the advancing Japanese troops, jails and asylums were opened and Rangoon was deserted except for the many Anglo-Burmese and Indians who remained at their posts. A stream of some 300,000 refugees fled across the jungles into India; known as 'The Trek', all but 30,000 of those 300,000 arrived in India. Initially the Japanese-led Burma Campaign succeeded and the British were expelled from most of Burma, but the British counter-attacked using primarily troops of the British Indian Army. By July 1945, the British had retaken the country. British troops firing a mortar on the Mawchi road, July 1944.[NEWLINE][TAB]Although many Burmese fought initially for the Japanese, some Burmese, mostly from the ethnic minorities, also served in the British Burma Army. In 1943, the Chin Levies and Kachin Levies were formed in the border districts of Burma still under British administration. The Burma Rifles fought as part of the Chindits under General Orde Wingate from 1943 to 1945. Later in the war, the Americans created American-Kachin Rangers who also fought against the Japanese. Many others fought with the British Special Operations Executive. The Burma Independence Army under the command of Aung San and the Arakan National Army fought with the Japanese from 1942-1944, but switched allegiance to the Allied side in 1945.[NEWLINE][TAB]British soldiers waged a guerrilla war against Japanese forces in Burma. Chindits were formed into long range penetration groups trained to operate deep behind Japanese lines. A similar American unit, Merrill's Marauders, followed the Chindits into the jungle in 1943. Overall, the Japanese lost some 150,000 men in Burma. Only 1,700 prisoners were taken.[NEWLINE][TAB]In 1947, Aung San became Deputy Chairman of the Executive Council of Burma, a transitional government. But in July 1947, political rivals assassinated Aung San and several cabinet members.[PARAGRAPH:2]On 4 January 1948, the nation became an independent republic, named the Union of Burma, with Sao Shwe Thaik as its first President and U Nu as its first Prime Minister. Unlike most other former British colonies and overseas territories, it did not become a member of the Commonwealth. A bicameral parliament was formed, consisting of a Chamber of Deputies and a Chamber of Nationalities, and multi-party elections were held in 1951-1952, 1956 and 1960.[NEWLINE][TAB]The geographical area Burma encompasses today can be traced to the Panglong Agreement, which combined Burma Proper, which consisted of Lower Burma and Upper Burma, and the Frontier Areas, which had been administered separately by the British.[NEWLINE][TAB]Democratic rule ended in 1962 when General Ne Win led a military coup d'閠at. He ruled for nearly 26 years and pursued policies under the rubric of the Burmese Way to Socialism. Between 1962 and 1974, Burma was ruled by a revolutionary council headed by the general, and almost all aspects of society (business, media, production) were nationalized or brought under government control (even the Boy Scouts). In an effort to consolidate power, Ne Win and many other top generals resigned from the military and took civilian posts and, from 1974, instituted elections in a one-party system.[NEWLINE][TAB]Between 1974 and 1988, Burma was effectively ruled by Ne Win through the Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP), which from 1964 until 1988 was the sole political party. During this period, Burma became one of the world's most impoverished countries. The Burmese Way to Socialism combined Soviet-style nationalisation and central planning with the governmental implementation of superstitious beliefs. Criticism was scathing, such as an article published in a February 1974 issue of Newsweek magazine describing the Burmese Way to Socialism as 'an amalgam of Buddhist and Marxist illogic'.[NEWLINE][TAB]A new constitution of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma was adopted in 1974.[NEWLINE][TAB]In 1988, unrest over economic mismanagement and political oppression by the government led to widespread pro-democracy demonstrations throughout the country known as the 8888 Uprising. Security forces killed thousands of demonstrators, and General Saw Maung staged a coup d'閠at and formed the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). In 1989, SLORC declared martial law after widespread protests. The military government finalised plans for People's Assembly elections on 31 May 1989. SLORC changed the country's official English name from the "Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma" to the "Union of Myanmar" in 1989.[NEWLINE][TAB]In May 1990, the government held free elections for the first time in almost 30 years. The National League for Democracy (NLD), the party of Aung San Suu Kyi, won 392 out of a total 489 seats(i.e., 80% of the seats), but the election results were annulled by SLORC, which refused to step down. Led by Than Shwe since 1992, the military regime has made cease-fire agreements with most ethnic guerilla groups. In 1992, SLORC unveiled plans to create a new constitution through the National Convention, which began 9 January 1993. In 1997, the State Law and Order Restoration Council was renamed the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC).[NEWLINE][TAB]During the 2007 anti-government protests a significant role was played by Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the opposition to the Burmese military government. Aung San Suu Kyi was under periods of house arrest from 1989-2010. In September 2007, hundreds of monks paid respects to her at the gate of her home, which was the first time in four years that people were able to see her in public. She was then given a second public appearance on 29 September, when she was allowed to leave house arrest briefly and meet with a UN envoy trying to persuade the junta to ease its crackdown against a pro-democracy uprising, to which the Myanmar government reluctantly agreed.</English>

Only 1,700 prisoners were taken.[NEWLINE][TAB]In 1947, Aung San became Deputy Chairman of the Executive Council of Burma, a transitional government. But in July 1947, political rivals assassinated Aung San and several cabinet members.[PARAGRAPH:2]On 4 January 1948, the nation became an independent republic, named the Union of Burma, with Sao Shwe Thaik as its first President and U Nu as its first Prime Minister. Unlike most other former British colonies and overseas territories, it did not become a member of the Commonwealth. A bicameral parliament was formed, consisting of a Chamber of Deputies and a Chamber of Nationalities, and multi-party elections were held in 1951-1952, 1956 and 1960.[NEWLINE][TAB]The geographical area Burma encompasses today can be traced to the Panglong Agreement, which combined Burma Proper, which consisted of Lower Burma and Upper Burma, and the Frontier Areas, which had been administered separately by the British.[NEWLINE][TAB]Democratic rule ended in 1962 when General Ne Win led a military coup d'鴡t. He ruled for nearly 26 years and pursued policies under the rubric of the Burmese Way to Socialism. Between 1962 and 1974, Burma was ruled by a revolutionary council headed by the general, and almost all aspects of society (business, media, production) were nationalized or brought under government control (even the Boy Scouts). In an effort to consolidate power, Ne Win and many other top generals resigned from the military and took civilian posts and, from 1974, instituted elections in a one-party system.[NEWLINE][TAB]Between 1974 and 1988, Burma was effectively ruled by Ne Win through the Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP), which from 1964 until 1988 was the sole political party. During this period, Burma became one of the world's most impoverished countries. The Burmese Way to Socialism combined Soviet-style nationalisation and central planning with the governmental implementation of superstitious beliefs. Criticism was scathing, such as an article published in a February 1974 issue of Newsweek magazine describing the Burmese Way to Socialism as 'an amalgam of Buddhist and Marxist illogic'.[NEWLINE][TAB]A new constitution of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma was adopted in 1974.[NEWLINE][TAB]In 1988, unrest over economic mismanagement and political oppression by the government led to widespread pro-democracy demonstrations throughout the country known as the 8888 Uprising. Security forces killed thousands of demonstrators, and General Saw Maung staged a coup d'鴡t and formed the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). In 1989, SLORC declared martial law after widespread protests. The military government finalised plans for People's Assembly elections on 31 May 1989. SLORC changed the country's official English name from the "Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma" to the "Union of Myanmar" in 1989.[NEWLINE][TAB]In May 1990, the government held free elections for the first time in almost 30 years. The National League for Democracy (NLD), the party of Aung San Suu Kyi, won 392 out of a total 489 seats(i.e., 80% of the seats), but the election results were annulled by SLORC, which refused to step down. Led by Than Shwe since 1992, the military regime has made cease-fire agreements with most ethnic guerilla groups. In 1992, SLORC unveiled plans to create a new constitution through the National Convention, which began 9 January 1993. In 1997, the State Law and Order Restoration Council was renamed the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC).[NEWLINE][TAB]During the 2007 anti-government protests a significant role was played by Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the opposition to the Burmese military government. Aung San Suu Kyi was under periods of house arrest from 1989-2010. In September 2007, hundreds of monks paid respects to her at the gate of her home, which was the first time in four years that people were able to see her in public. She was then given a second public appearance on 29 September, when she was allowed to leave house arrest briefly and meet with a UN envoy trying to persuade the junta to ease its crackdown against a pro-democracy uprising, to which the Myanmar government reluctantly agreed.</Chinese>

		<English>[H1]Augustus Caesar[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Emperor of the Roman Empire[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 63 BC - 14 AD[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Born Gaius Octavius, Augustus would become the first (and possibly greatest) Roman Emperor. He ended a century of civil wars and initiated two hundred years of the Pax Romana (Roman Peace) while overseeing a golden age of Roman literature and culture. Octavius was born in 63 BC. His father (also named Gaius Octavius) was a respectable but undistinguished member of the equestrian order. His mother, however, was a niece of Julius Caesar. Octavius' father died when he was only four years old, and he was brought up in the house of his stepfather Lucius Marcus Phillippus.[PARAGRAPH:2]At the age of fifteen, Octavius put on the toga virilis ("manly robes"), the symbol that he had reached adulthood and was elected to the College of Pontiffs. In 46 BC he joined Julius Caesar during Caesar's last campaign in Spain. In Spain he made such a fine impression on the great general that Julius Caesar changed his will to make Octavius his heir. When Caesar was murdered on the Ides of March in 44 BC, all the wealth that Caesar had spent a lifetime accumulating passed into the hands of the 18-year old Octavius. He would use them well.[PARAGRAPH:2]At the time of Caesar's assassination, Octavius was with some of his soldiers in modern-day Albania. Upon hearing the news he went to Italy and recruited an army from among Caesar's veterans, gaining their loyalty by stressing that he was Caesar's heir. Once in Rome, Octavius allied with Marc Antony and Marcus Lepidus to form what is known as the "Second Triumvirate," directed against Caesar's killers Marcus Brutus and Gaius Cassius. Octavius' and Antony's armies tracked down Brutus and Cassius in Greece, where they defeated the assassins' army at Philippi (42 BC). Brutus and Cassius both committed suicide after their defeat.[PARAGRAPH:2]Antony married Octavius' sister Octavia to cement their alliance, and the two leaders divided Rome's territory between them. Octavius took the west, while Antony went to the east, where he entered into a torrid affair with Cleopatra, the ruler of Egypt. Octavius saw Antony's actions as an insult to his sister and to his family, and relations between the co-rulers soon soured. While Antony enjoyed the pleasures of Egypt, back in Rome Octavius strengthened his political position and his armies. The two eventually went to war, and in 31 BC Octavius defeated the forces of Antony and Cleopatra at the naval battle of Actium. The lovers were pursued to Egypt, where they both committed suicide.[PARAGRAPH:2]Octavius was now the undisputed master of Rome. He surrendered his extraordinary powers to the Senate, which was filled with his allies; in return the Senate named , him "Augustus" (one who is marked by dignity and greatness) and showered him with honors. More importantly, they also gave him the powers of a Roman consul, tribune, and censor, which had never before been combined into one office. All permanent legal power within Rome officially remained within the Senate - but since Octavius controlled the senate, this was mostly a legal fiction. Although he had all of the power of an Emperor, Augustus preferred to style himself "Princeps," or "first citizen" (probably to avoid further antagonizing the remaining republicans in Rome).[PARAGRAPH:2]During his reign Augustus presided over four decades of peace and prosperity, a welcome relief to Rome after almost a century of civil strife. He carried out a great building program in the ancient city, constructing a new Senate house as well as great temples to Apollo and "Divine Julius" (his deceased great-uncle). Later, Augustus would boast - with justification - that he had found Rome a city of brick and left it marble. Under his patronage many of the most famous Roman authors and poets created their great works: Virgil, Ovid, Horace, and Livy all flourished during his reign.[PARAGRAPH:2]Augustus' generals also enjoyed great success and were quite relieved to be once again turning their military strength against external enemies instead of one another. Rome's borders were extended to the Danube; northern Spain was finally conquered; and Armenia was pacified in the east. By Augustus' death in 14 AD, a return to the old system of the Republic was unthinkable. He was peacefully succeeded by the Emperor Tiberius, and for more than two centuries the Roman Empire would dominate the Mediterranean without any major wars - due in large part to the wise statesmanship of Augustus.</English>

		<English>[TAB]In March 1808 AD, the Portuguese royal family and ministers arrived in Rio de Janeiro to take refuge in Brazil as Napoleon's forces overran their homeland. The prince regent Joao, ruling in the stead of his mother Maria I, who was incapacitated due to mental illness, re-established his capital in Rio and ruled the empire from there. While in residence, he put in place all the ministries of a sovereign capital, as well as founding a royal library, a military academy, a royal mint, a printing office, and medical and law schools. In 1815, Joao declared Brazil a kingdom, co-equal with Portugal in the empire. Following the defeat of France, he preferred to remain in Brazil until called back to Portugal to deal with radical revolts. In April 1821, Joao appointed his son Pedro to the regency. Pedro's ministers, many Brazilian born, urged independence; the young regent issued a declaration of independence for Brazil in September 1822 and was crowned as Emperor Pedro I within three months. In 1825 the Portuguese government officially recognized Brazil's sovereignty, and within the year most of the European nations followed suit.[PARAGRAPH:2]General Ernesto Geisel assumed the presidency in 1974, and immediately launched into a "slow, gradual and safe" policy of returning rule to a democratic government. Over several years he ended the torture of political prisoners, censorship of the press, and finally the junta itself when he repealed the Fifth Institutional Act. His successor continued the process, and in 1985 the first free elections made Jose Sarney president. With a stable government and thriving economy, Brazil has since taken a leading role in regional affairs, being a founding member of organizations such as the Latin Union, Organization of American States, Mercosul, and Union of South American Nations. At the beginning of a new millennium, Brazil is poised to assume an equally influential role on the world stage.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Red Fort, or Lal Qila, is a 17th century fort complex constructed by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in the walled city of Old Delhi (in present day Delhi, India). Shah Jahan moved his capital here from Agra in a move designed to bring prestige to his reign, and to provide ample opportunity to apply his ambitious building schemes and interests. It served as the capital of the Mughals until 1857, when Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar was exiled by the British Indian  government.[PARAGRAPH:1]Shah Jahan started construction of the massive fort in 1638 and work was completed in 1648. The Red Fort was originally referred to as "Qila-i-Mubarak" (the blessed fort), because it was the residence of the royal family. The layout of the Red Fort was organised to retain and integrate this site with the Salimgarh Fort. The fortress palace was an important focal point of the medieval city of Shahjahanabad. The planning and aesthetics of the Red Fort represent the zenith of Mughal creativity which prevailed during the reign of Emperor Shah Jahan.</English>

The dominant figure of Canadian Confederation, he had a political career which spanned almost half a century. He drank heavily, and in 1873 was voted out during the Pacific Scandal, in which his party took bribes from businessmen seeking the contract to build the Pacific Railway. Macdonald's greatest achievements were building and guiding a successful national government for the new Dominion, using patronage to forge a strong Conservative Party, promoting the protective tariff of the National Policy, and building the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway. Economic growth was slow during his years in office, as Canada verged on stagnation; many residents migrated to the fast-growing United States. He fought to block provincial efforts to take power back from Ottawa. His most controversial move was to approve the execution of M锟絫is leader Louis Riel for treason in 1885; it permanently alienated the Francophones who saw themselves humiliated.[PARAGRAPH:2]Macdonald was born in Scotland; when he was a boy his family immigrated to Kingston in the colony of Upper Canada (today in eastern Ontario). As a lawyer he was involved in several high-profile cases and quickly became prominent in Kingston, which elected him in 1844 to the legislature of the colonial United Province of Canada. By 1857 had become premier under the colony's unstable political system.[PARAGRAPH:2]When in 1864 no party proved capable of governing for long, Macdonald agreed to a proposal from his political rival, George Brown, that the parties unite in a Great Coalition to seek federation and political reform. Macdonald was the leading figure in the subsequent discussions and conferences, which resulted in the British North America Act and the birth of Canada as a nation on 1 July 1867.[PARAGRAPH:2]Macdonald was the first Prime Minister of the new nation, and served 19 years; only William Lyon Mackenzie King served longer.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Vietnamese civilization has existed for thousands of years. Vietnamese legends hold that native people populated and civilized the land more than 4,000 years ago. Chinese historical records tell of an indigenous people that existed about 2,500 years ago. Some historians, both in Asia and in the West, hold that the various peoples of today's Vietnam were brought together by a Qin Dynasty-era general who was fed up with the despotic rule of the Qin Shi Huang (First emperor of China proper) and escaped to the "southern Yue [Viet] mountains" to set up his own kingdom. He and his soldiers conquered the land and established a civilized society modeled after ancient Chinese customs. This Chinese general adopted the native language (which sounded similar to southern Chinese dialects anyway) and married local women, who gave birth to sons that inherited the kingdom. Whether this is indeed historically true or not is still subject to debate.[PARAGRAPH:2]What is known for sure is that for most of the period from 207 BC to the early 10th century, it was under the rule of successive dynasties of China. Sporadic independence movements were attempted, but were quickly extinguished by the Chinese army. In 939, the Vietnamese defeated Chinese forces at the Bach Dang River and gained independence. They gained complete autonomy a century later. For most of its history, Vietnam has been strongly influenced by its much bigger northern neighbor, China. However, during the rule of the Tran Dynasty, it defeated three Mongol attempts of invasion by the Yuan Dynasty. Feudalism in Vietnam reached its zenith in the Le Dynasty 1400s, especially with the emperor Le Thanh Tong. Between the 13th and 17th centuries, the Vietnamese expanded southward in a process known as nam tien (southward expansion). They eventually conquered the kingdom of Champa and much of the Khmer empire. [PARAGRAPH:2]The independent period ended in the mid-19th century, when the country was colonized by France.  French rule continued until World War II, when Japan briefly occupied Vietnam and used the country as a base to launch attacks against the rest of Indochina and India. When the war ended, France attempted to re-establish control but failed, after they were defeated at Dien Bien Phu. There was overwhelming support for a unified country, however, the West, particularly the United States feared that the highly popular Ho Chi Minh would easily win any election.[PARAGRAPH:2]The US under the Kennedy administration began to send military advisors into Vietnam and things quickly escalated from there.  The Communist strongholds in the North were supported by China and the Soviet Union while the regime set up in the South was supported by the United States. The conflict quickly escalated into the Vietnam War; one of the most controversial wars in history.  All American troops were withdrawn by March 29, 1973. By April 30, 1975, North Vietnam had overtaken the puppet regime in South Vietnam and by 1976, Vietnam was finally unified the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.

At 122 metres (400 ft) it was the world's tallest stupa and the third tallest structure in the world when it was built by King Mahasena of Anuradhapura (273-301). He initiated the construction of the stupa following the destruction of the Mahavihara. His son Maghavanna I completed the construction of the stupa. A part of a sash or belt tied by the Buddha is believed to be the relic that is enshrined here.[PARAGRAPH:2]The structure is significant in the island's history as it represents the tensions within the Theravada and Mahayana sects of Buddhism; it is also significant in recorded history as one of the tallest structures in the ancient world; and the second tallest non-pyramidal buildings after Pharos (lighthouse) of Alexandria; the height of the stupa was 400 feet (122 m), making it the tallest stupa in the ancient world. With the destruction and abandonment of Anuradhapura kingdom in the 11th century, the stupa with others was covered by jungle. King Parakramabahu in 12th century tried to renovate this stupa and it was rebuilt to the current height, a reduction from the original height. Today it stands at 232 feet (71 meters).[PARAGRAPH:2]The structure is no longer the tallest, but it is still the largest, with a base-area of 233,000 m2 (2,508,000 sq ft). Approximately 93.3 million baked bricks were used in its construction; the engineering ingenuity behind the construction of the structure is a significant development in the history of the island. The sectarian differences between the Buddhist monks also are represented by the stupa as it was built on the premises of the destroyed mahavihara, which led to a rebellion by a minister of King Mahasena.[PARAGRAPH:2]This stupa belongs to the Sagalika sect. The compound covers approximately 5.6 hectares and is estimated to have housed 10,000 Buddhist monks. One side of the stupa is 576 ft (176 m) long, and the flights of stairs at each of the four sides of it are 28 ft (9 m) wide. The doorpost to the shrine, which is situated in the courtyard, is 27 ft (8 m) high. The stupa has a 8.5 m (28 ft) deep foundation, and sits on bedrock. Stone inscriptions in the courtyard give the names of people who donated to the building effort.</English>

Originally constructed around 256 BC by the State of Qin as an irrigation and flood control project, it is still in use today. The system's infrastructure develops on the Min River (Minjiang), the longest tributary of the Yangtze. The area is in the west part of the Chengdu Plain, between the Sichuan basin and the Tibetan plateau. Originally, the Min would rush down from the Min Mountains and slow down abruptly after reaching the Chengdu Plain, filling the watercourse with silt, thus making the nearby areas extremely prone to floods. Li Bing, then governor of Shu for the state of Qin, and his son headed the construction of the Dujiangyan, which harnessed the river using a new method of channeling and dividing the water rather than simply damming it. The water management scheme is still in use today to irrigate over 5,300 square kilometres (2,000 sq mi) of land in the region. The Dujiangyan, the Zhengguo Canal in Shaanxi and the Lingqu Canal in Guangxi are collectively known as the "three great hydraulic engineering projects of the Qin."</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_SOLAR_PLANT_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]Solar power uses the energy of direct sunlight to generate electrical energy. It is typically gathered through one of two basic methods: One is solar-thermal, in which the sun's rays are concentrated in a specific location through the use of mirrors until the heat is great enough to boil water. The boiling water then drives turbines which run electric generators. The other method is to use 'panels' of photovoltaic materials. Being struck by light causes electrons to flow in these materials, generating a steady electric current.[PARAGRAPH:2]Both methods have varying advantages and disadvantages. Among the advantages are that solar power requires few or no moving parts and emits no harmful gases or other pollution, aside from that associated with manufacturing the panels themselves. Among the disadvantages is the obvious one that power derived from sunlight is not available at night, is of limited availability on cloudy or misty days, and is available only for a short time or at unfavorable angles in the polar regions or during winter.[PARAGRAPH:2]The massive supply of sunlight striking the Earth's surface (including in utterly unpopulated, desert regions, and the surface of the sea) makes solar power an attractive choice for providing human energy needs into the distant future, as fossil fuel availability diminishes. The key challenges to be overcome are:[PARAGRAPH:2]1) Storing massive amounts of energy, comparable to those released by nuclear explosions, overnight. This needed so that solar plants can 'charge up' our storage infrastructure so that it can provide electricity at times of low or no sunlight.[PARAGRAPH:2]2) Producing solar panels at a cost that makes them broadly competitive with energy-rich fuels such as coal and uranium.[PARAGRAPH:2]3) Supplying any rare metals needed for production of the panels[PARAGRAPH:2]4) Establishing long-range transmission infrastructure so that efficient solar plants in sunny regions can be used to provide power in foggy, cloudy, or high-latitude regions.</English>

Gold and silver were widely used in such transactions, but the pieces needed to be weighed and tested for purity each time they changed hands.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 600 BC, the Lydians found a way around this problem. They began the practice of shaping electrum, an alloy of gold and silver, into pieces of predetermined weight and purity, stamped with an official symbol. This idea caught on, and within 50 years all the important trading centers of the world had adopted similar practices.

Muslim chemists and alchemists were the first to employ the experimental scientific method (as practised in modern chemistry), while Muslim alchemists also developed theories on the transmutation of metals, the philosopher's stone and the Takwin (artificial creation of life in the laboratory), like in later medieval European alchemy, though these alchemical theories were rejected by practical Muslim chemists from the 9th century onwards.[PARAGRAPH:1]Early Islamic chemists such as Jabir ibn Hayyan, Al-Kindi and Al-Razi contributed key chemical discoveries, including: distillation apparatus (such as the alembic, still, and retort), the hydrochloric, sulfuric, nitric and acetic acids, soda and potash, purified distilled alcohol, aqua regia, perfumery and many more chemical substances and apparatus.</English>

He was the third son of Shah Mohammad. Abbas came to the throne during a troubled time for Iran. Under his weak-willed father, the country was riven with discord between the different factions of the Qizilbash army, who killed Abbas' mother and elder brother. Meanwhile, Iran's enemies, the Ottoman Empire and the Uzbeks, exploited this political chaos to seize territory for themselves. In 1587, one of the Qizilbash leaders, Murshid Qoli Khan, overthrew Shah Mohammed in a coup and placed the 16-year-old Abbas on the throne. But Abbas was no puppet and soon seized power for himself. He reduced the influence of the Qizilbash in the government and the military and reformed the army, enabling him to fight the Ottomans and Uzbeks and reconquer Iran's lost provinces. He also took back land from the Portuguese and the Mughals. Abbas was a great builder and moved his kingdom's capital from Qazvin to Esfahan. In his later years, the shah became suspicious of his own sons and had them killed or blinded.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Ch&#226;teau Frontenac is one of Canada's grand railway hotels built by the Canadian Pacific Railway. The Ch&#226;teauesque architectural style used throughout the hotel would later serve as a template for other Canadian grand railway hotels erected in the late-19th to early-20th century. The central fortress-like tower design is derived from medieval chateaus found throughout France's Loire Valley. Ch&#226;teauesque elements include the hotel's asymmetrical profile, with steeply pitched roofs, massive circular and polygonal towers and turrets, ornate gables and dormers, and tall chimneys. The exterior base of the hotel is largely made of grey stone ashlar, with steel framing running up the building, Glenboig brick cladding. Materials that make up the interior of the building includes mahogany panelling, marble staircases, carved stone, wrought iron, and glass roundels. However, as opposed the other Ch&#226;teauesque-styled buildings found in France, the Ch&#226;teau Frontenac did not utilize elements of Italianate architecture, instead placing a greater emphasis on Gothic elements. The hotel also draws certain elements from Victorian style of architecture, with rich polychromatic surfaces throughout its exterior.[PARAGRAPH:2]Built in 1892-93, the Ch&#226;teau Frontenac was originally designed by architect Bruce Price. Price's plan called for a horseshoe-shaped hotel, made up of four wings of unequal length, connected at obtuse angles. Public rooms made up the majority of the first two floors of Price's designs. The original proposal called for a square structure, however the completion of the Terrasse Dufferin led to the development for a more picturesque building. Since its completion, the hotel has undergone several major expansions and renovations led by several different architects and architectural firms. William Sutherland Maxwell led two major expansions to the hotel, one in 1908-09, and another in 1920-24 (co-led with his brother, Edward Maxwell). Renovations in the 1990s was led by the Arcop, a architectural firm based in Montreal. The hotel was again expanded in 1993, with the addition of a new wing.[PARAGRAPH:2]Access to the hotel's main entrance is marked by several porte-coch&#232;re with large dormers and a cupola. The porte-coch&#232;re leads guests into the hotel's centre courtyard, as well as the entrance to the hotel's main lobby. The building stands 80-metre-tall (260 ft), containing 18 floors primarily made up of guest rooms and other hotel amenities. After the addition of the tallest tower in 1924, the hotel became the tallest building in Quebec City. It remained the city's tallest building until 1930, when &#201;difice Price was completed just northeast of the hotel. Although several buildings in Quebec City are taller, the hotel continues to hold a prominent position in the city's skyline, as it is perched atop a tall cape overlooking the Saint Lawrence River.</English>

Its construction completed by Xerxes I. Modern scholarships "demonstrates the metaphorical nature of the Apadana reliefs as idealised social orders".[PARAGRAPH:2]The Apadana was the largest building on the Terrace at Persepolis and was excavated by the German archaeologist Ernst Herzfeld and his assistant Friedrich Krefter, and Erich Schmidt, between 1931 and 1939. Important material relevant to the excavations are today housed in the archives of the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. It was most likely the main hall of the kings. The columns reached 20m high and had complex capitals in the shape of bulls or lions. Here, the great king received the tribute from all the nations in the Achaemenid Empire, and gave presents in return. Access to the hall is given by two monumental stairways, on the north and on the east. These are decorated by reliefs, showing delegates of the 23 subject nations of the Persian Empire paying tribute to Darius I, who is represented seated centrally.

However, prior to the rise of rail and steamship travel in the 19th century, travel was typically slow enough that travelers' lodgings would be decentralized affairs. As the upper and middle classes gained more access to fast transportation, it became more necessary to accomodate itinerant travelers who would literally be "here today, gone tomorrow," in accordance to a predictable schedule.[PARAGRAPH:2]This gradually led to the evolution of the hotel in its modern form - a large, typically multi-story building with individual rooms or small suites for one or more guests, including bathing facilities, a bed, and various other amenities. Rooms are generally cleaned and maintained by a permanent hotel staff, with clerks present at all hours of day and night to track the flow of guests in and out of the building and to reserve rooms for future clients. While the details vary (and prices can vary by as much as an order of magnitude depending on quality), hotels following this basic outline can be found throughout the modern world.[PARAGRAPH:2]Since travelers depend on professional hotel services to keep a roof over their heads, hotels have become an indispensible part of modern travel.

This is generally the case for societies that inhabit territory insufficient to support it and that are forced to expand to meet their needs. However, expansionism can also be the cultural norms: societies that value military prowess require constant warfare for new generations of leaders to prove their worth. While such a culture can make a civilisation quite adept at warfare, it also leads to economies that are heavily reliant on the influx of wealth brought about by looting and tribute. In consequence, they are at risk of collapse as soon they suffer their first military setback.

He was only 17 years old when he was elected king by the Greek National Assembly, which had deposed the unpopular former king Otto. His nomination was both suggested and supported by the Great Powers: the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Second French Empire and the Russian Empire. He married the Russian grand duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia, and became the first monarch of a new Greek dynasty. Two of his sisters, Alexandra and Dagmar, married into the British and Russian royal families. King Edward VII and Tsar Alexander III were his brothers-in-law and King George V and Tsar Nicholas II were his nephews.[PARAGRAPH:2]George's reign of almost 50 years (the longest in modern Greek history) was characterized by territorial gains as Greece established its place in pre-World War I Europe. Britain ceded the Ionian Islands peacefully, while Thessaly was annexed from the Ottoman Empire after the Russo-Turkish War (1877锟?878). Greece was not always successful in its expansionist ambitions; it was defeated in the Greco-Turkish War (1897). During the First Balkan War, after Greek troops had occupied much of Greek Macedonia, George was assassinated in Thessaloniki.

		<English>[TAB]The Native Americans were the original inhabitants of North America, emigrating roughly 16,000 years ago. The term "Native American" most often refers to the people who settled in the northern continent of the Western Hemisphere, in the land that is today owned by the United States and Canada. At the time of the arrival of Columbus, thousands of Native American tribes populated the furthest reaches of North America, with somewhere between two and 18 million Natives living in this region. (The "Native American" civilization in the game represents the empire that would have formed had these disparate people ever united.)[PARAGRAPH:1]The northern Native Americans never developed a system of writing (the Mayans to the south were the only Native Americans to do so), so the history of the Native Americans before the arrival of the Europeans is difficult to piece together. It is known, however, that these original inhabitants had crossed a land bridge (since gone) connecting Siberia with Alaska. As these Siberian immigrants spread south and east across the continent in search of sustenance, they encountered many different climates, ecologies, and geographies. Settling from within a stone's throw of the Arctic Circle to the most desolate regions of the American Southwest, the Native Americans were a testament to human adaptability.[PARAGRAPH:1]Given the diversity of lands which they inhabited, not to mention the vast distances separating them, the Native Americans never formed a unified nation. Powerful local entities - such as the Six Nations (also known as the "Iroquois Confederacy") - would appear periodically, but for the most part tribes remained the largest political organization.[PARAGRAPH:1]With the arrival of the Europeans in the New World, the Native American tribes would be forced to adapt to yet another hostile environment. As the United States established itself as a nation, the Native Americans were perceived as a roadblock to American supremacy - a roadblock which needed to be removed. Andrew Jackson, before his election as the seventh President of the United States, waged total war against the Seminoles in Florida and obliterated the Creek Indians at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. As President, he signed into effect the "Indian Removal Act" of 1830, the precedent to numerous future "relocation treaties." The Treaty of New Echota, one such relocation treaty, was signed between the United States government and a tiny fraction of the Cherokee people. The march of the Cherokee from their homeland in the eastern United States to new territory in Oklahoma and Arkansas cost the lives of some four thousand natives, and would later become known as the "Trail of Tears."[PARAGRAPH:1]The continual pushes westwards by American settlers further displaced the Natives, resulting in a series of conflicts known as the "Indian Wars." However, the Native Americans were never able to unify on a grand enough scale to stop the Europeans or their descendents. A common scenario began to occur. Various individual tribes would fight tooth and nail against the invaders and be nearly defeated. These tribes would then be enticed into signing treaties that would often be ignored by the Americans and the tribe would once again be pushed on at the point of a bayonet. The state of Oklahoma was originally given to Native Americans who had been forced from the east, but then in the 1890s, was opened in chunks for American settlement.[PARAGRAPH:1]By the beginning of the twentieth century, between 75 and 95 percent of the Native American population had been destroyed by starvation, disease or warfare. The reservation system had consigned most survivors to usually undesirable land throughout the United States, and over the next several decades, the rates of alcoholism and suicide among the Native American population skyrocketed. But during the 1960's, a revival of Native American heritage began to emerge. Today, over two million Native Americans live in roughly 563 tribes across the United States. Native American artists such as author Sherman Alexie have beautifully conveyed the travails endured by modern Native Americans in poetry and prose, and proud peoples once forced onto reservations have again begun to spread throughout the United States.</English>

		<Chinese>[BOLD]策略提示:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]特洛伊人能在敌人围攻下坚持十年之久，但和北美土著相比却只能说是小巫见大巫。北美土著文明是擅用投射武器的顽强防御者，拥有许多保护自己的有效手段。北美土著领袖的“保国”特质可以加速城墙的建造，并使投射类及火器类单位自动获得特定晋升。北美土著替代纪念碑的特色建筑——图腾柱又可给予投射单位额外的经验奖励。有了这些还不够，北美土著替代斧兵的特色单位——猎犬战士拥有对其他肉搏兵种的高额战斗加成，而且无须铜铁资源即可组建。如此之多的防御优势再加上坐牛的“思辨”特质催生的历史伟人，你强大的帝国卫队足以令特洛伊国王普利阿摩斯感到自愧不如。[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]背景:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]北美土著是北美洲的原住民。他们在大约16000年以前就迁到北美洲定居了。“北美土著”这个专有名词多用于表示以前定居于西半球北部大陆上的人（现在，这些土地属于美国和加拿大）。当哥伦布到达的时候，数以千计的北美土著部落散布在北美洲的每个角落。大约有2百万到1千8百万之间的土著生活在这个地区。（在游戏中，“北美土著”这个文明表现的是一个由这些迥异的部落联合起来所组成的虚拟帝国。）[PARAGRAPH:1]由于北部的北美土著一直都没有发展出一套书写系统（南部的玛雅人是唯一发展出书写系统的美洲原住民）。所以，在欧洲人到达之前的北美土著历史难以一窥全貌。尽管如此，公认的是这些原住民是穿越了连接西伯利亚和阿拉斯加两地的大陆桥（现在已经不存在了）而来的。这些西伯利亚移民迫于生计向南部和东部迁徙，足迹遍布整个北美大陆。在这期间，他们遇到了各种各样的气候条件，生态环境和地理环境。这些北美土著的居住地从距离北极圈一箭之遥的地方一直扩展到北美西南部最荒凉的地区，他们是人类强大适应能力的一个证明。[PARAGRAPH:1]由于他们居住地之间的差异，所以北美土著部落从来就没有形成过一个统一的国家（即使不考虑他们之间的距离之大）。虽然强大的区域性势力——比如说六族（也被称为“易洛魁联盟”）——周而复始地出现。但是，很大程度上来说，部落依然是最大的政治组织。[PARAGRAPH:1]随着欧洲人抵达新大陆，北美土著部落不得不去适应另一个充满敌视的环境。当美国建国的时候，北美土著就成了美国霸权的阻碍，而且是必须被排除掉的阻碍。安德鲁·杰克逊在当选为美国第七任总统之前，曾经对佛罗里达的米诺尔人发动了全面战争，还在马蹄弯战役中灭亡了克里克族印第安人。1830年，他以总统的身份签署生效了“印第安人移居法”。该法案开了后来众多“移居条约”的先例。比如美国政府和少数切罗基族人签订的新艾克塔条约就是一条典型的移居条约。切罗基人从他们美国东部的故土迁移到了俄克拉荷马州和阿肯色州的新领地。在这次长途跋涉中，大约四千土著人失去了他们的生命。这就是后来有名的“血泪之路”。[PARAGRAPH:1]美国移民持续不断的西进活动使得土著人流离失所的情况进一步加剧，并最终导致了一系列的流血冲突，史称“印第安战争”。但是，北美土著一直无法团结起足够大的力量来阻止欧洲人及其后裔。一幕常见的情景开始上演。各个部落与侵略者孤军奋战，最后独力难支，几乎溃败。然后这些部落被诱使着签署了一些条约。当然，美国人经常会“忘掉”他们曾经签署过的条约，而这些部落也经常再次被推到刺刀前。例如：俄克拉荷马州最初划给了那些从东部强制迁来的北美土著。但是在19世纪90年代，该州却向美国移民全面开放。[PARAGRAPH:1]在二十世纪初，有百分之七十五到百分之九十五的北美土著人死于饥饿，疾病或者战争。美国的保留地制度中分配给幸存者的土地通常都是整个美国中无人问津的土地。而在接下来的几十年里，北美土著人中酗酒和自杀的比率暴涨。不过在20世纪60年代，北美土著传统的复兴运动开始出现。现在，有超过2百万的北美土著生活在大约563个部落中，横跨整个美国。许多像作家谢尔曼·亚历克西一样的北美土著艺术家们用诗歌和散文巧妙地表达了现代北美土著所经受的苦难。同时，也表达了土著人们的自豪——虽然曾经被迫迁移到保留地上，但是今天再次开始发展壮大起来，遍布美国各地。</Chinese>

At its height, the Khmer Empire covered fully one half of Southeast Asia, encompassing what is today Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and parts of Myanmar.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Khmer Empire was founded on the remnants of the kingdom of Chenla, which had spread itself across much of Cambodia and Laos, but had become fractured and weakened by the eighth century AD.  A former Chenla prince, Jayvaraman II, returned to the area after his education in Java and created the base of power for the Khmer Empire in the region that is today central Cambodia.[PARAGRAPH:2]The fractured state of Southeast Asia after the collapse of Chenla made the unified strength of the Khmer a welcome presence in the region. The new nation quickly annexed many of its smaller neighbors, sometimes peacefully, sometimes less so.[PARAGRAPH:2]As their prominence grew, the Khmer kings initiated many grand public works projects. King Yasovarman I, ruling from 889 to 915, built Yasodharapura, the first major capital of the Khmer, on a site that would remain important throughout Khmer history. Yasovarman also constructed the East Baray, a massive raised reservoir that was capable of holding over 60 million cubic meters of water.[PARAGRAPH:2]Not long after Yasovarman's reign, internal struggles began to sweep the Khmer Empire. And while a number of impressive works of construction were completed during this period, it was not until the reign of Jayavarman V, from 968 to 1001 that the Khmer Empire could again find itself in relative peace. And it would still be another century until Suryavarman II would again make the Khmer a force to be reckoned with.[PARAGRAPH:2]Ascending to the throne in 1113, Suryavarman II established himself as a firm ruler over the squabbling princes that wreaked havoc on the reign of his father, Suryavarman I. Wisely guiding the forces within his nation, Suryavarman the younger would turn the Khmer Empire into the most powerful kingdom in southeast Asia. Extending his domain over much of neighboring Thailand and Myanmar and constructing Angkor Wat, a monumental temple complex erected not far from the site of the original Khmer capital of Yasodharapura, Suryavarman would guide his Empire to its greatest heights.[PARAGRAPH:2]Shortly after the death of Suryavarman in 1150, relations would sour between the Khmer and the Champa Empire, former allies of the Khmer, and would lead to the sacking of Angkor Wat in 1177, nearly drawing to an end the reign of the Khmer kingdom. The kingdom would be given one last flourish under the reign of Jayavarman VII, whose keen military insight brought the Champa under Khmer control. A devout Buddhist, Jayavarman also littered the Cambodian countryside with new temples.[PARAGRAPH:2]Jayavarman's reign would mark the end of the powerful rulers of the Khmer.

		<Chinese>位于东南亚地区的古代高棉王国存在时间从公元790年起至1431年止。在其鼎盛时期，高棉王国的疆域覆盖了半个东南亚，包括今柬埔寨、老挝、泰国和缅甸的部分地区。[PARAGRAPH:1]高棉王国是在原真腊王国的废墟之上建立起来的，真腊王国曾占有今柬埔寨和老挝的大部分地区，但到公元8世纪时已分崩离析。此时真腊国的一位王子耶跋摩二世从爪哇求学归来，在今柬埔寨中部建立了高棉王国最初的统治中心。[PARAGRAPH:1]在真腊王国崩溃之后，东南亚地区小国林立，纷争不断，拥有统一力量的高棉符合人们的诉求。这个新兴国家迅速合并了许多邻邦，有时是通过和平方式，有时则是通过战争手段。[PARAGRAPH:1]随着实力的增强，历任高棉统治者启动了许多大型公共工程。耶输跋摩一世（889-915在位）建造了耶输陀罗补罗（耶输陀罗城），这是高棉的第一座大型都城，在整个高棉历史中均保持着重要的地位。耶输跋摩还建造了“东湖”――一座巨大的人工湖，能够蓄水6千万立方米。[PARAGRAPH:1]耶输跋摩去世之后，高棉王国迅速陷入内乱。虽然在这一时期仍完成了许多巨大的工程，但直到耶跋摩五世（968-1001在位）统治时期，高棉王国才逐渐恢复和平安定。又过了一个世纪，高棉才在苏耶跋摩二世的领导下重新强盛起来。[PARAGRAPH:1]苏耶跋摩二世于1113年登上王位，他迅速终结了其父苏耶跋摩一世统治时期国内诸侯纷争的局面，建立起稳固的统治。年轻的苏耶跋摩明智地实施因势利导的政策，使高棉发展成为东南亚第一强国。他将疆域拓展到今泰国和缅甸地区，并建造了吴哥窟，这座巨大的神庙建筑群位于高棉旧都耶输陀罗补罗附近。在苏耶跋摩治下，他的帝国进入了全盛时期。[PARAGRAPH:1]苏耶跋摩于1150年去世，此后高棉王国与原先的盟友占婆王国之间的关系迅速恶化，占婆军队于1177年攻陷并劫掠了吴哥窟，高棉几乎因此而亡国。耶跋摩七世统治下的高棉经历了最后的繁荣，他通过出色的军事才能控制了占婆全境。耶跋摩是一位虔诚的佛教徒，他建造的许多佛寺至今仍散布于柬埔寨各地。[PARAGRAPH:1]耶跋摩七世是高棉最后一位强势统治者。泰人于1350年发动起义建立了大城王朝，到1431年时这个政权已将原高棉王国的全部领土置于其统治之下。</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]Slavery is a system whereby some people are judged far inferior to others and are treated as objects or possessions, with no more rights than those afforded to chairs or cattle. Slavery has existed as long as human history, from the earliest primitive times to the enlightened days of Greece and Rome and right up until today. Sometimes convicted criminals were made into slaves. Sometimes captured enemies of the state were enslaved. Sometimes people of a specific race or coloration were enslaved. In some civilizations a person could purchase their freedom or were allotted it after being enslaved for a specific period of time.[PARAGRAPH:2]The advantage of slavery is that it allows people to be forced to do jobs that they would otherwise refuse to do without adequate compensation. Cheap labor results in concentration of wealth and thus the creation of great buildings and temples or the maintenance of large professional armies. Aside from its basic moral repugnance, the disadvantages of slavery are numerous: it corrupts both slave and master, it badly underutilizes the intelligence and creativity of the subject people, and it almost inevitably leads to revolts and internal strife. </English>

		<Chinese>奴隶制度是将一部分“劣等人”视为物品或财产的制度，奴隶拥有的权利并不比一头牛或一把椅子更多。奴隶制在人类文明产生之后即已出现，从原始时代，到古希腊和罗马，甚至在今天仍然存在。奴隶的来源有时是被定罪的犯人。有时是敌国的战俘。有时一个部族会全体沦为奴隶。在有的文明中，奴隶可以用钱赎得自由，或经过规定的时间后脱离奴隶身份。[PARAGRAPH:2]奴隶制的优势是统治者可以强迫奴隶做自由人不愿做的工作而无须增加报酬。廉价的劳动力能创造大量财富，使宏伟的宫殿和神庙得以建成，庞大的职业军队得以维持。除了在道德上的不合理性，奴隶制还存在许多负面作用：它使奴隶和奴隶主阶级都趋于堕落，压制了人民大众的智慧和创造力，几乎不可避免地会造成暴动内乱。</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]The United States is young by Civilization standards, being barely more than 200 years old. The United States did not expand to reach its current borders until the middle of the 19th century, and did not become a true world power until the middle of the 20th century. America was the first European colony to separate successfully from its motherland, and it was among the first nations to be established on the premise that sovereignty rests with its citizens and not with the government.[PARAGRAPH:2]Prior to the 1770s, the American colonists were loyal subjects of the British Empire, but a combination of taxes and ministerial mismanagement of the situation led to the outbreak of revolution in 1776. George Washington, the leader of the colonial forces during the Revolutionary War and later First President of the United States, along with the other Founding Fathers, managed to win the fight for independence against all odds and lay the constitutional foundation for America's future growth. In its first century and a half, the country was mainly preoccupied with its own territorial exploration, internal development, and economic growth. American politics evolved from quasi-aristocratic beginnings to become increasingly democratic during the 1820s and '30s. But despite the nation's rapid acquisition of territory and dramatic population growth, the spectre of slavery continued to divide the country between North and South. The struggle between anti- and pro-slavery advocates eventually erupted in a bloody Civil War that lasted four years and consumed hundreds of thousands of lives. In the end, the Union was preserved and the power of the central federal government greatly strengthened compared to before the conflict.[PARAGRAPH:2]Following the Civil War, the nation entered a period of unprecedented prosperity after the long conflict and reconstruction. In the ensuing two decades industrial production, the number of industrial workers, and the number of factories all more than doubled. European immigration, westward expansion, urban growth, technological advances, and a host of American inventions - including the telephone, typewriter, linotype, phonograph, electric light, cash register, air brake, refrigerator car, and the automobile - contributed to the American explosion, while widespread use of corporate organization offered new opportunities for large-scale financing of business enterprise and attracted new capital. But despite America's growth as one of the world's leading industrial powers, the nation still remained isolationist in outlook, paying little to no attention to the world outside its borders.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Spanish-American War of 1898 marked the emergence of the United States onto the world's stage as a major power, but it was not until World War I that the country truly became invovled in world politics. Following the 1919 Versailles Peace Conference, the nation again turned its back on the rest of the world and enjoyed the prosperous decade known as the "Roaring Twenties". Unfortunately, this economic boom was not to last. Wall Street's stock market crashed in 1929 and kicked off the Great Depression of the 1930s. In the midst of constant bank failures and rampant unemployment, Franklin Roosevelt was elected president and set about to fix the country through his recovery plan called the "New Deal". The program was a mixed success economically, but helped restore hope and confidence to a people that were in serious need of both. Roosevelt then went on to lead the United States through the crucible of World War II, dying a few months before victory was won.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Allied victory at the end of World War II left the United States as one of the world's two "superpowers" along with the Soviet Union. In only a few short years the two former allies had become opponents in the Cold War, a tense diplomatic standoff that would last for forty years. Domestically, the nation enjoyed considerable prosperity in the 1950s, experienced a turbulent period of cultural and social change in the 1960s, and suffered through economic stagnation in the 1970s, with recovery taking place in the following decades. Since the collapse of the Soviet empire in 1989-91, the United States has been left alone as the world's sole remaining superpower. Rather than facing conventional armies on the field of battle, America is now threatened by terrorist groups who make no distinction between military and civilian targets. Highly trained special operations units like the Navy SEALs are often used to combat these enemies using advanced weaponry. But for all of its overwhelming economic and military strength, the United States will have to work together with other nations in order to meet the threats of the modern world.</English>

		<Chinese>按照人类文明的标准，美利坚合众国是一个相对年轻的国度，自建立至今只有两百多年的历史。美国直到19世纪中叶才达到目前的疆域范围，并且直到20世纪中叶才真正成为一个世界级强国。美国是最早成功独立于欧洲母国的美洲殖民地，它也是最早将“主权在民”的理念作为立国之本的国家。[PARAGRAPH:2]在其18世纪70年代之前，北美殖民地居民是大英帝国的忠实臣民，但是一系列苛捐杂税和错误政策最终导致了1776年独立战争的爆发。乔治·华盛顿是独立战争期间的大陆军总司令，后来成为美利坚合众国的第一任总统，他与其他独立运动先驱一道战胜重重艰难险阻赢得国家独立，并为美国未来的发展奠定了宪政基础。在立国后的一百多年间，这个国家主要致力于在北美大陆的探索，扩张领土以及发展经济。到19世纪20至30年代，美国开始由最初实际上的准贵族政体转变为日益民主化的政体。但是，虽然美国的领土不断扩张，人口持续增长，对奴隶制度的不同态度却开始造成南北对峙局面的形成。奴隶制的支持者和反对者之间的斗争导致一场持续四年、伤亡无数的血腥内战最终爆发。到战争结束时，美国恢复了国家的统一，联邦政府的权力也得到极大的强化。[PARAGRAPH:2]结束内战之后的美国进入了前所未有的繁荣时期。在二十年间民族工业开始获得长足的发展，工厂和产业工人的数量都增长了一倍以上。欧洲移民的迁入、西部的开发、城市的扩展、技术的进步以及无数美国人发明创造精神的迸发——包括电话、打字机、行式排印机、留声机、电灯、收银机、气压制动器、冷冻车厢以及汽车——这一切使得美国以爆炸性的速度迅速发展，日益推广的股份公司制度使工商企业有机会获得了大量商机，并吸引新的资本不断投入。虽然此时的美国已经发展成为世界上最重要的制造业中心，但是在政治上却仍然采取孤立主义态度，对境外的事务基本上漠不关心。[PARAGRAPH:2]在军事方面，1898年爆发的美西战争历时短暂，伤亡轻微，在现代的战史上几乎不值一提，但这场战争却标志着美利坚合众国作为列强的一员开始跃上世界舞台。然而直到第一次世界大战爆发之后，美国才真正参预到世界政治事务当中。1919年凡尔赛和约签订时，这个国家又再次远离世界政治，专注于推动国内的经济繁荣，这一时期又被称为“沸腾的二十年代”。不幸的是，这样的繁荣未能持续下去。华尔街股票市场在1929年全面崩溃，从此揭开了三十年代大萧条的序幕。在银行接连倒闭，失业率持续上升的环境下，富兰克林·罗斯福当选新一届的总统，他着手实施“新政”努力推动国家复苏。这一政策在经济方面并非完全成功，但使得美国人逐渐恢复了曾经失去的希望和信心。此后罗斯福又领导美国安然度过了第二次世界大战的风风雨雨，但他在战争即将取得胜利的前夕离开了人世。[PARAGRAPH:2]盟军在二战中的最后胜利使美国成为和苏联并列的超级大国，但仅仅数年时间这对昔日的盟友就变成了冷战的对手，紧张的政治和外交对峙状态持续了四十年。而在国内，美国经历了五十年代的经济繁荣、六十年代的社会和文化动荡，以及七十年代的经济停滞，进入八十年代后又再次复苏。在1989-1991年的政治动荡导致苏联解体后，美国成为世上唯一的超级大国。今日美国所面临的最大威胁不是来自常规战场上的敌方正规军队，而是来自不断暗中袭击军事和民用目标的恐怖分子。以海豹突击队为代表、经过专门训练、装备尖端武器的特种部队经常被用于对付此类隐藏的敌人。尽管拥有压倒性的经济和军事实力，美国仍然需要与其他国家团结协作，共同消除当代世界所面临的各种威胁。</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]Julius Caesar's Gallic Wars brought the Germanic tribes into the spotlight of history. Although Roman efforts to establish hegemony across the Rhine continued for decades, the frontier eventually stabilized along the Rhine and Danube rivers. At that time, Germanic culture extended from Scandinavia as far south as the Carpathians. Although it was heavily fortified, the frontier was never a barrier to trade or culture. Germanic fear of the Huns eventually drove many of the tribes inside the borders of the Roman Empire in the 4th and 5th centuries, where the weakened Romans were unable to contain them. The Eastern Roman Empire survived the crisis and lasted for another thousand years, but the Germanic peoples carved out their own independent kingdoms in the West.[PARAGRAPH:2]Of the various Germanics tribes that had invaded the Roman Empire, the Franks proved to be the most successful. The Merovingian kings and their Carolingian successors eventually brought much of what would later constitute Germany under Frankish control, but the ceaseless blows from Danes, Saracens (Muslims), and Magyars in the later 9th and 10th centuries weakened the kingdom's cohesion. Because the Carolingians themselves were unable to provide effective defense for the empire, there arose in nearly all the German lands powerful lines of margraves, counts, and hereditary rulers; their intrigues and wars against each other were interrupted only briefly by the rise of strong emperors such as Frederick Barbarossa (1155-1190). The subsequent history of Germany is, despite the role of the central rule of the Holy Roman Empire, one of the rise and fall of feuding principalities. It would be a thousand years before Germany was again unified under a single ruler.[PARAGRAPH:2]Out of the hundreds of states that made up Germany, it was the kingdom of Prussia that would eventually succeed in bringing them together. Beginning as a small duchy on the shores of the Baltic Sea, the rulers of Prussia gradually accumulated more and more territory through a combination of warfare and marriage agreements. King Frederick William I (1713-40) trained the Prussian army to be one of the finest in Europe, and his son Frederick II (1740-86) - also known as Frederick the Great - used it to win a series of military victories against the larger kingdoms of Austria and Russia. Frederick was also known as a patron of the arts, his court attracting intellectuals such as Voltaire from across Europe. Ruling as an enlightened despot, Frederick was equally skilled at defeating Russian invasions and playing the flute.[PARAGRAPH:2]Following its humiliation and defeat in the wars of the French Revolution and Napoleon, Prussia managed to bounce back and reorganize itself along more modern lines. Troubled by the popular uprisings that had occurred across Germany during the 1848 revolutions, William I of Prussia (1861-1888) considered abdicating in favor of his son, who was believed to have political views close to those of the liberal opposition. He was persuaded, however, to consider forming a new government led by Otto von Bismarck, the Prussian ambassador to Paris. In September 1862, Europe was startled by the news that a statesman with a reputation for conservatism, nationalism, and [realpolitik] had become the prime minister of Prussia. Bismarck proved to be a master strategist, and the new German Empire was proclaimed in January 1871, in the aftermath of three short and decisive wars against Denmark, Austria, and France. In the span of a decade, Bismarck had unified Germany - or, as some would say, Prussia had conquered it.[PARAGRAPH:2]The same nationalism that had brought unity would also bring disaster. Ignoring the careful diplomacy that had isolated Prussia's opponent in each of Bismarck's wars, Germany rushed into World War I against a coalition of Britain, France, and Russia. Despite initial successes, the war eventually turned into a stalemate that Germany could not win, especially once the United Stated entered the war on the Entente side in 1917. Already staggering under a vengeful peace imposed by the Western Allies following World War I, the worldwide economic collapse that began in 1929 proved the catalyst for political extremism. Although bitterly opposed to each other, the Nazis and Communists during the next decade succeeded in mobilizing the political and economic resentments generated by defeat and depression.  When Hitler finally became chancellor in January 1933, it was not on the crest of a wave of popular support but as the result of ruthless political intrigue.[PARAGRAPH:2]World War II is appropriately called "Hitler's War." Spearheaded by Panzer formations using revolutionary new tactics, Hitler came close to realizing his aim of establishing German hegemony in Europe. But the turning point of the war came with his decision to send his Panzers into Soviet Russia. Though at the end of 1942 an ultimate German victory still seemed possible, by spring 1945 the Third Reich was prostrate. As a legacy of surrender and the ensuing Cold War, a truncated Germany was divided into two zones of military occupation. While under Soviet rule East Germany suffered and stagnated, West Germany's recovery from total economic and political prostration at the end of World War II was of such dramatic proportions as to become a modern legend. The swift and unexpected downfall of the Soviet order in Europe led to a unification treaty, ratified by the West German Bundestag and the East German People's Chamber in September 1990. After 45 years of division, Germany was once again a united nation. Today Germany is one of the world's economic powerhouses, and a leading force in the European Union.</English>

		<Chinese>朱利乌斯·恺撒发动的高卢战争第一次使日尔曼各部族的名字出现在历史舞台上。虽然罗马人为控制莱茵河以东地区而进行了数十年的努力，但最终帝国的边界还是稳定在了莱茵河与多瑙河一线。当时日尔曼文化的范围从斯堪的纳维亚向南一直延伸到喀尔巴阡山脉。虽然有重兵把守，帝国的北方边界从来都不是贸易与文化交流的障碍。公元4到5世纪，日尔曼各部对于匈奴人的恐惧驱使许多部落进入罗马帝国的疆域，而衰落了的罗马帝国无法控制住他们。东罗马帝国渡过了危机并又延续了一千年，而日尔曼人在西罗马帝国的版图上建立起了他们自己的独立王国。[PARAGRAPH:2]在所有入侵罗马帝国的日尔曼部落当中，法兰克人是最成功的。墨洛温王朝及其后的加洛林王朝历任国王经过长期努力，最终将今日德国的大部分地区置于法兰克人的统治之下，但是由于在9世纪晚期和整个10世纪不断遭受丹麦人，撒拉森人和马扎尔人的入侵，王国的凝聚力逐渐削弱。由于加洛林王朝自身不能有效地保卫其国土，在地方上崛起了许多侯爵、伯爵和其他世袭统治者，他们之间的明争暗斗只是由于个别强力选侯——比如人称“巴巴罗萨”的腓特烈一世（1155-1190在位）——的崛起才偶受遏止。尽管有神圣罗马帝国（第一帝国）名义上的中央集权统治，此后德意志历史的主导者却仍是相互之间纷争不断，此消彼长的封建诸侯。直到千年之后，才再次在统一在一个领袖的意志之下。[PARAGRAPH:2]近代以前的德意志实际上只是由上百个独立诸侯构成的地理名词，最终成功地将他们团结到一起的是普鲁士王国。从巴伦支海滨的一个小公爵领开始发迹，普鲁士的历任统治者们通过战争和联姻手段的结合逐步扩大了其版图。腓特烈·威廉一世（1713-1740在位）将普鲁士军队训练成了欧洲第一流的军队。他的儿子腓特烈二世（1740-1786在位，即著名的腓特烈大帝）凭借这支部队赢得了对欧洲列强奥地利和俄罗斯的一系列军事胜利。腓特烈还以艺术的资助人而闻名，他的宫廷吸引了全欧洲的学者，例如伏尔泰。作为一位开明君主的典范，腓特烈演奏长笛的技巧堪与他击败俄军入侵的指挥艺术相比。[PARAGRAPH:2]在经历了法国大革命和拿破仑战争中的失败和羞辱之后，普鲁士决心卷土重来并将自己改革成更现代化的国家。受到横扫全欧的1848年大革命的打击，普鲁士国王威廉一世（1861-1888在位），决定让位给他的儿子。虽然新继位的威廉二世本人的政治观点倾向于自由主义者，但最终他还是同意让时任普鲁士驻法国大使的奥托·冯·俾斯麦出面组建新政府。1862年9月，欧洲被一条新闻震惊：一个以保守主义，民族主义和实力政治而闻名的政治家成为普鲁士的首相。俾斯麦被证明是一位战略大师，在连续赢得三场对丹麦，奥地利和法国的短暂而决定性的战争之后，新的德意志帝国（第二帝国）于1871年1月宣布成立。在经过了十年的努力之后，俾斯麦使德国最终获得统一，或者说，普鲁士征服了整个德意志。[PARAGRAPH:2]给德意志带来统一的民族主义同样也给它带来了灾难。无视俾斯麦在战争中擅长的孤立普鲁士的对手的谨慎外交政策，德国一头闯进第一次世界大战，面对英、法、俄的同盟。尽管起初进展顺利，战争最终陷入德国无望获胜的僵局，特别是1917年美国加入协约国一方之后，失败无可避免。本已在一次大战后被西方联盟强加的报复性条约下艰难度日，1929年的世界性经济崩溃更成了德国政治转向极端主义的催化剂。在随后的十年里，纳粹思想成功地使遭受战争失败和经济衰退的德国人的苦难和怨恨爆发。希特勒最终在1933年1月成为德国的总理，这并非出于民众的一致拥戴，而是拜无情的政治阴谋所赐。[PARAGRAPH:2]第二次世界大战在某种程度上可以被称做“希特勒的战争”。以采用革命性新战术的德国装甲兵部队作为先锋，希特勒几乎实现了他在欧洲建立德国霸权的目标。但当他决定派遣他的装甲兵部队进攻苏维埃俄国之后，战争形势开始逆转。尽管在1942年底时德国看起来仍有可能获得最终胜利，但到1945年春天，“第三帝国”最终崩溃。作为战败者和冷战的后果，已遭压缩的德国又被分为两块军事占领区。战后的东德在苏联统治之下遭受痛苦和萧条时，西德却从经济和政治窘境中迅速全面地得到恢复，这样富于戏剧性的对比已经成为一个现代传奇。苏联意外而迅速的解体导致东欧的巨变，西德联邦议院和东德人民议会乃于1990年9月签订合并条约。历经45年分裂之后，德国再次成为一个统一的国家。今日德国是世界经济的主导者之一，也是欧盟的主导国之一。</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]The bulk of the fighting hosts were made of up general purpose levies and volunteers, but most Kongo polities maintained a small core of dedicated soldiers- nucleus of a standing army. Special detachments and commands called lucanzos were also used for various missions, and one such under a commander called Kakula ka Kabasa was defeated by the Portuguese in 1586 when crossing a river. Other special troops sometimes used included elite scouting units, the pombos, who sometimes ran with, and kept up with horses when they were used in the region. The pombos also performed pursuit duties. "Light" and "heavy" troop types were recognized. The light troops were far more numerous, and relied more on individual skill and technique (dodging spears for example). The "heavies" were more disciplined and relied on stronger defensive weapons and formations. A limited number such types operated in the Kongo kingdom, and were armed with shields, unlike other forces. They were reputedly the best soldiers in the country. Tactical units were recognized, from basic sections of 100-125 men, to larger units of 500, called mozengos or embalos. Groupings of these units made up a specific field force that could number up to 15,000 troops.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_CIVIC_TRIBUTARIES_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]Many Asian civilisations regarded tributary relationships as being more desirable than outright control. Tribute would pacify surrounding powers as well as provide additional income, while requiring no direct military control over defeated enemies. This was especially useful in the relationship with far away powers or those which inhabited rough terrain. Various Chinese dynasties throughout history sought to receive tribute both from the nomads to its north as well as states in South East Asia. The Mongol Empire used the same practice, for example for the fractured states in medieval Russia. In South East Asia, the Mandala system was almost entirely built around tributaries, where important centers such as Ayutthaya, Java or Angkor only kept informal control over their sphere of influence.</English>

		<English>[H1]Boudica[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Queen of the Celts[NEWLINE]Lived:[\BOLD] ? - 61AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Boudica was a queen of the Iceni, a Celtic people who lived on the eastern coast of Britain. The Roman Emperor Claudius had conquered much of Britain some twenty years ago; according to the treaty with the Iceni, Boudica's husband King Prasutagus would continue to rule his kingdom until his death, at which time it would come under Roman rule. Prasutagus died in approximately 60 AD, and the Romans were quick to seize control of the kingdom. According to the historical sources, the Romans treated their new subjects with unbridled cruelty, and greed. Boudica and her daughters were beaten and raped and sent like beggars from their kingdom.[PARAGRAPH:1]This was a huge mistake. The Romans badly underestimated the Celtic Queen: they would have been far better off killing her outright or treating her with the respect her title deserved.[PARAGRAPH:1]According to Cassius Dio, a Roman historian, Boudica was "very tall, in appearance most terrifying, in the glance of her eye most fierce, and her voice was harsh; a great mass of the tawniest hair fell to her hips; around her neck was a large golden necklace." She was also possessed of a great intelligence and was beloved by her people.[PARAGRAPH:1]After her humiliation Boudica convinced a number of nearby kingdoms to revolt against the rapacious Romans; they quickly raised a large army and made Boudica the commander.[PARAGRAPH:1]At the time, Paulus, the Roman in charge of the island's military forces, was away on business. In his absence Boudica's army wreaked havoc across the island, visiting on their Roman prisoners the same sort of depredations the Romans had recently tormented the Celts with. A number of Roman cities were burned, and the campaign ended with the capture and destruction of the important city of "Londinium" (London).[PARAGRAPH:1]By then the Roman forces had rallied, and though badly outnumbered, had decided to make their stand some miles distant from Boudica. The queen immediately launched an attack against the hated foe. Although she had the great advantage of numbers, her army was no match for the disciplined and highly-trained Roman troops, who blunted the initial Celtic rush with a wave of thrown javelins and then proceeded to kill every Celtic warrior they could catch. Boudica is said to have killed herself rather than risk Roman capture.[PARAGRAPH:1]Although she had led her people for only a year, Boudica's valiant but doomed rebellion would make her a legendary figure in history. Europe would not see another female warrior of her quality for some fourteen centuries, until a young woman named "Joan" would a see vision telling her to rise and fight for the Catholic King of France.</English>

Arguably the first nation to discover America, under Joao's reign Portugal made several other important discoveries while also advancing the field of nautical navigation.[PARAGRAPH:2]"I am the lord of lords, not the server of servants." These words, originally a castigation of rebellious nobles by Joao, would come to define the Portuguese king's reign. Joao's dislike of court intrigue and the inability for political opinion to influence his decisions made him an unpopular king amongst his peers. The King's early rule was defined by his efforts to curtail, and eventually crush, all internal corruption and opposition to his rule. After having intercepted conspiratorial letters between the Duke of Braganza and Queen Isabella I of Castile in 1483, Joao had the Duke executed, his family banished from Portugal, and his lands and wealth confiscated.[PARAGRAPH:2]Joao II's policies focused primarily on the exploration and exploitation of maritime trade routes, particularly with India. The full extent of Portugal's explorations and discoveries remain largely unknown due to the government's secrecy, born of a fierce competition with its neighbor Castile. It is, however, argued that Portugal had already reached North America and Brazil by 1470 and 1480, respectively. This places their discovery of North America in advance of Christopher Columbus's voyage.[PARAGRAPH:2]Portugal, under the reign of Joao, was also credited with the 1484 discovery of the Congo River, the 1488 rounding of the Cape of Good Hope (Africa's southern tip), and the 1493 settlement of the S&#227;o Tom&#233; and Pr&#237;ncipe Islands.[PARAGRAPH:2]Disputes over rights of exploration between Castile and Aragon and Portugal would eventually lead to the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) which split the world in half. Portugal would be responsible for exploring the Eastern hemisphere while Aragon and Castile would have the Western hemisphere.[PARAGRAPH:2]Towards the end of his reign, Joao's only legitimate heir, Alfonso, died under mysterious circumstances. This prevented Portugal from inheriting ownership of Castile and Aragon through Alfonso's marriage to Isabella of Aragon - Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon's eldest daughter. Joao II died without male heir in 1495, possibly poisoned by the vengeful Portuguese nobility and was succeeded by his first cousin, Manuel I.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Archaeological evidence indicates that humans have been living on the Korean peninsula for the last 700,000 years. The earliest discovered settlements date back to at least 3000 BC. According to legend, Korean history began in 2333 BC when King Dangun founded the kingdom of Gojoseon. Dangun was said to have been born of the son of Heaven and a woman from a bear-totem tribe; ancient Korea was characterized by clan communities which combined to form small city-states. The Bronze Age began around 1000 BC in Korea, and many weapons from this period have been found, as well as archaeological evidence of walled settlements. This suggests that the Korean city-states did not always enjoy peaceful relations with one another, despite their nominal unity under the Kingdom of Gojoseon. The kingdom of Gojoseon came to an end in 109 BC when the Chinese launched a massive invasion near the Liao River. The Chinese established four provinces in northern Korea and Manchuria, but were unable to hold these for any length of time.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the fall of the Gojoseon kingdom, three new states emerged in Korea (these are collectively known as the "Three Kingdoms"). Baekje was founded in 18 BC on the southwest of the Korean Peninsula; it was based around the city of Seoul and played an important role in transporting Chinese culture (such as Buddhism, iron making, the Chinese alphabet, etc.) across the sea to Japan. Goguryeo was founded in 37 BC; it usually was the largest of the three kingdoms. In addition to its Korean citizens, it also included Chinese and Tugusic tribesman from Manchuria. Finally, the third kingdom of Silla (founded 57 BC) was culturally distinct from the other two because of the cultural influence of northern nomads from the steppes - Baekje and Goguryeo were mostly dominated by Chinese culture. The three kingdoms coexisted on the peninsula for over six centuries, until King Munmu of Silla ordered an attack on Baekje in 660 AD. With the help of forces from Tang China, the Sillans conquered first Baekje and then Goguryeo (in 668 AD). The Sillans then drove out the Chinese and ruled over a united Korean state.[PARAGRAPH:2]Unified Silla remained peaceful and prosperous for the next two centuries, until it was overthrown in 935 AD by a new dynasty, the kingdom of Goryeo, which would last for over four hundred years. During this period laws were codified, a civil service system was introduced, and Buddhism spread throughout the Korean peninsula. In 1231 the Mongols invaded Korea, and the king of Goryeo was forced to surrender a short time later. Under the treaty of capitulation the Korean kings continued to rule as a figurehead, while the Mongols held all of the real power. As time passed the Mongol power began to decline, and in the 1340s King Kongmin was able to throw them out. Upon regaining power the Goryeo dynasty enacted important reforms to the government. It remained in power some fifty years, until overthrown by the turncoat Korean general Yi Seonggye in 1392.[PARAGRAPH:2]Yi Seonggye had been sent to China to fight against the Ming Chinese, but once there he switched sides and returned to Korea backed by Chinese power. He then overthrew the Goryeo Dynasty and founded his own. This new Joseon Dynasty moved the capital to Seoul and adopted Confucianism as the state religion, causing great loss of power and wealth by Korea's Buddhists. The Joseon state successfully fought off a series of invasions from Japan between 1592 and 1598, but succumbed to an attack by the Qing Dynasty of China in 1636. For the next two centuries Korea remained nominally independent, but in actuality was a province of the Chinese Qing Empire.[PARAGRAPH:2]At the end of the nineteenth century Korea was invaded and occupied by Japan after its victories over China in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-95) and Russia in the Russo-Japanese War (1904-05). The Japanese ruthlessly exploited the Korean population and attempted to destroy the Korean culture in order to replace it with their own. After Japan's defeat in World War II (1945), Korea was divided at the thirty-eighth parallel into north and south regions, a division which the Korean War of 1950-53 made permanent.

		<Chinese>（塞爱维小提示：以下内容基本属于高丽人意淫，不足为信，姑妄听之可也）[PARAGRAPH:2:1]考古证据表明早在70万年前，朝鲜（高丽）半岛上就有人类居住，目前发现的最早人类定居点则可上溯至公元前3000年。根据神话传说，高丽民族的历史是从公元前2333年开始的，在这一年，“檀君大王”建立了“古朝鲜王国”。据说檀君系天上下凡的父亲和一位以熊为图腾的部落女子所生。古朝鲜实际上包括了各个部族组成的许多小城邦。古朝鲜约于公元前1000年进入青铜时代，当时制造的兵器有大量出土，考古证据也表明这一时期的居民点已有城墙保护。以上情况说明各个城邦虽然在名义上同属于古朝鲜王国，但相互之间并不总是和平相处的。古朝鲜王国最终于公元前109年灭亡，当时中国汉朝军队越过辽河，对其发动大规模入侵。汉朝在今朝鲜半岛北部及中国东北地区建立了四个郡治，但其统治所维持的时间并不长久。[PARAGRAPH:2:1]古朝鲜王国灭亡后，朝鲜半岛上逐渐形成了三个新国家（合称“三国”）。其中百济建立于公元前18年，位于半岛西南部以今首尔市为中心的地区，在输入中华文化（例如佛教、铁器、汉字）并向日本传播方面发挥了重要的作用。高句丽建立于公元前37年，在三国中面积最大，高句丽的居民除了朝鲜人，还包括今中国东北地区的汉人和通古斯人。新罗建立于公元前57年，在文化上深受亚洲北部游牧民族的影响，同另两国存在明显的差异——百济和高句丽基本是以中华文化为主导的。三国鼎立的状态在朝鲜半岛保持了六个世纪之久，直到660年新罗的文武大王开始对百济的进攻。在中国唐朝军队的帮助下，新罗先后征服了百济和高句丽（668年）。新罗随后又逐走唐军，最终统一了整个朝鲜半岛。[PARAGRAPH:2:1]统一的新罗王国在此后两个世纪保持和平与繁荣，直到935年被一个新的王朝——高丽所取代，高丽王朝的统治持续了四百余年。高丽王朝制定了完备的法律，引入了文官制度，并定佛教为官方信仰，遍传整个朝鲜半岛。到1231年，蒙古入侵高丽，高丽国王被迫投降。高丽国王虽仍是名义上的统治者，但实际权力均掌握在蒙古人手中。随着时间的推移蒙古开始走向衰落，到14世纪40年代，高丽恭愍王终于摆脱了蒙古人的控制重新掌权，并大力推动政治改革，但其后高丽王朝仅维持了约五十年，即于1392年被大将李成桂发动的兵变所推翻。[PARAGRAPH:2:1]李成桂受高丽国王之命出兵对抗中国明朝军队，但却在阵前倒戈相向，在中国军队的支持下杀回国都，废黜旧主自立为王。李成桂建立的朝鲜李氏王朝迁都汉阳（今首尔），并改奉儒学为官方信仰，在高丽王朝受到厚待的佛教势力遭受沉重打击。李氏朝鲜成功击退了1592至1598年的日本入侵（“壬辰倭乱”），但却于1636年被清军征服。此后的两个世纪，朝鲜保持着名义上的独立，但实际上已是中国清朝属下的一个省份。[PARAGRAPH:2:1]到19世纪末，迅速崛起的日本连续赢得中日甲午战争（1894-95）和日俄战争（1904-05）的胜利，入侵并吞并了朝鲜。日本人残酷地压迫朝鲜人民，并试图消灭朝鲜文化，以日本文化取而代之。日本在第二次世界大战中战败后（1945年），朝鲜以北纬38度线为界被一分为二，1950-53年的朝鲜战争使分裂状态持续至今。南朝鲜（大韩民国）逐步发展为繁荣的经济强国，而北朝鲜（朝鲜民主主义人民共和国）则在共产政权统治下陷于停滞状态。[PARAGRAPH:2:1]</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]Totalitarianism (or totalitarian rule) is a political system where the state recognizes no limits to its authority and strives to regulate every aspect of public and private life wherever feasible. Totalitarian regimes stay in political power through an all-encompassing propaganda campaign, which is disseminated through the state-controlled mass media, a single party that is often marked by political repression, personality cultism, control over the economy, regulation and restriction of speech, mass surveillance, and widespread use of terror. It is not synonymous with dictatorship, as authoritarian regimes also exhibit dictatorial features, but do not create an all-controlling, all-politicised society. Furthermore, non-dictatorial governments and societies are sometimes denounced as having totalitarian features, including democratic socialism, capitalism and liberal democracy.[PARAGRAPH:2]The concept of totalitarianism was first developed in a positive sense in the 1920s by the Italian fascists. The concept became prominent in Western anti-communist political discourse during the Cold War era in order to highlight perceived similarities between Nazi Germany and other fascist regimes on the one hand, and Soviet communism on the other.[PARAGRAPH:2]Aside from fascist and Stalinist movements that are totalitarian, there have been other movements that are totalitarian. The leader of the historic Spanish reactionary conservative movement called the Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right declared his intention to "give Spain a true unity, a new spirit, a totalitarian polity..." and went on to say "Democracy is not an end but a means to the conquest of the new state. When the time comes, either parliament submits or we will eliminate it." Baathist Iraq was distinctly ultra-nationalist and totalitarian, and has been dubbed by historian Stanley G. Payne as "the closest" reproduction of the Third Reich. Several revolutionary fundamentalist regimes have been pointed out as totalitarian, including post-revolutionary Iran.</English>

Tipu Sultan had 27 brigades (called 'Kushoons') and each brigade had a company of rocket men called 'Jourks'. In the Second Anglo-Mysore war, at the Battle of Pollilur (10 September 1780), Hyder and Tipu achieved a grand victory, the contributory cause being that one of the British ammunition tambrils was set on fire by Mysorean rockets.[PARAGRAPH:2]At the Battle of Seringapatam in 1792, Indian soldiers launched a huge barrage of rockets against British troops, followed by an assault of 36,000 men. Although the Indian rockets were primitive by modern standards, their sheer numbers, noise and brilliance were said to have been quite effective at disorienting British soldiers. During the night, the rockets were often seen as blue lights bursting in the air. Since Indian forces were able to launch these bursting rockets from in front of and behind British lines, they were a tremendous tool for throwing the British off guard. The bursting rockets were usually followed by a deadly shower of rockets aimed directly at the soldiers. Some of these rockets passed from the front of the British columns to the rear, inflicting injury and death as they passed. Sharp bamboo was typically affixed to the rockets, which were designed to bounce along the ground to produce maximum damage. Two of the rockets fired by Indian troops in 1792 war are on display at the Royal Artillery Museum in London.[PARAGRAPH:2]Later at the Battle of Srirangapattana (4th Anglo-Mysore war) April 1799, British forces lead by Col Arthur Wellesley (Duke of Wellington) ran away from battlefield when attacked by rockets and musket fire of Tipu Sultan's army. Unlike contemporary rockets whose combustion chamber was made of wood (bamboo), Tipu's rockets weighing between 2.2 to 5.5 kg used iron cylinder casing that allowed greater pressure, thrust and range (1.5 to 2.5 km).[PARAGRAPH:2]The British were greatly impressed by the Mysorean rockets using iron tubes.

In 1894, Nobel purchased the Bofors iron and steel mill, which he made into a major armaments manufacturer. Nobel also invented ballistite. This invention was a precursor to many smokeless military explosives, especially the British smokeless powder cordite. As a consequence of his patent claims, Nobel was eventually involved in a patent infringement lawsuit over cordite. Nobel amassed a fortune during his lifetime, with most of his wealth coming from his 355 inventions, of which dynamite is the most famous.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1888, Nobel was astonished to read his own obituary, titled The merchant of death is dead, in a French newspaper. As it was Alfred's brother Ludvig who had died, the obituary was eight years premature. The article disconcerted Nobel and made him apprehensive about how he would be remembered. This inspired him to change his will. On 10 December 1896, Alfred Nobel died in his villa in San Remo, Italy, from a cerebral haemorrhage. He was 63 years old.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime. He composed the last over a year before he died, signing it at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in Paris on 27 November 1895. To widespread astonishment, Nobel's last will specified that his fortune be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer the "greatest benefit on mankind" in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, and peace. Nobel bequeathed 94% of his total assets, 31 million SEK (c. US$186 million, 150 million Euros in 2008), to establish the five Nobel Prizes. Because of skepticism surrounding the will, it was not until 26 April 1897 that it was approved by the Storting in Norway.

Passive ring-shaped (enceinte) fortifications of the Medieval era proved vulnerable to damage or destruction by cannon fire, when it could be directed from outside against a perpendicular masonry wall. In addition, an attacking force that could get close to the wall was able to conduct undermining operations in relative safety, as the defenders could not shoot at them from nearby walls. In contrast, the star fortress was a very flat structure composed of many triangular bastions, specifically designed to cover each other, and a ditch. Further structures, such as ravelins, hornworks or crownworks, and detached forts could be added to create a complex symmetrical structure.[PARAGRAPH:2]Star fortifications were further developed in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries primarily in response to the French invasion of the Italian peninsula. The French army was equipped with new cannon and bombards that were easily able to destroy traditional fortifications built in the Middle Ages. In order to counteract the power of the new weapons, defensive walls were made lower and thicker. They were built of many materials, usually earth and brick, as brick does not shatter on impact from a cannonball as does stone. Another important design modification were the bastions that characterized the new fortresses. In order to improve the defense of the fortress, covering fire had to be provided, often from multiple angles. The result was the development of star-shaped fortresses.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Originally several separate territories under the control of the Holy Roman Empire, and then united into one state under Habsburg rule (16th century), the Netherlands did not acquire national independence until the conclusion of the Eighty Years' War (1568-1648 AD) when the Spanish formally renounced all claims to Dutch sovereignty in the Treaty of M&#252;nster.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Eighty Years' War was sparked by Spanish religious oppression and an occupation by Spanish forces led by the Duke of Alba, during which over one thousand people were sentenced to death, including two prominent and popular Dutch nobles; these actions caused dissention among the Dutch people. In 1568 Willem, Prince of Orange, returned from a self-imposed exile (in order to avoid prosecution by the Duke of Alba) and led the uprising against the Spanish occupation.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Dutch fight for independence can be seen as a war against religious oppression, with the Pacification of Ghent treaty being a written representation of this sentiment. Signed on November 8th, 1576 the document specified an alliance between the Dutch provinces, in which religious differences would be put aside for the purposes of expelling the Spanish and restoring local provincial control to the Netherlands.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the seventeenth century the Dutch began using their large military and merchant navies to both create their own trading posts along the African coast and rob those of the Portuguese in an effort to reach valuable markets in India and Indonesia. The inrush of treasure, trade and knowledge from these trading and military expeditions was extremely beneficial, and during this first half of the seventeenth century the Dutch experienced a Golden Age of cultural and economic growth. This Golden Age would soon come to a crushing end.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1795, France, under Napoleon I, conquered the Dutch mainland. The Netherlands quickly declined in influence and power, locally and internationally, with the British taking most of their colonial possessions. After Napoleon was defeated a few colonial territories were restored to the Dutch and remained under their control until the decolonization of the twentieth century.[PARAGRAPH:2]Many historians regard the Dutch empire as the first truly capitalist country. In addition to developing the first stock exchange, many modern services such as corporate insurance and retirement funds were attributed to Dutch inventiveness.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Netherlands is also the birthplace of one of the world's early democratic institutions - the Dutch Water Boards. Due to the unique topography of the Netherlands - about half of the mainland is a foot or more under sea level - the country's waterways must be constantly monitored and controlled in order to prevent flooding that would result in tremendous loss of life and property. Each Water Board is in charge of one of the nation's 27 water districts and all matters pertaining to local water management. The creation of these water boards predates the Netherlands itself.[PARAGRAPH:2]The modern Netherlands, with a diverse population and liberal laws towards drugs, prostitution, abortion, same-sex marriage, and euthanasia, has been a constant haven for refugees from other countries. Cultural minorities are encouraged to protect their own cultural identity while at the same time integrate into Dutch culture at large, further reinforcing the open-minded ideals for which Dutch ancestors fought and died.</English>

		<Chinese>荷兰起初是从属于神圣罗马帝国的几个省份，在16世纪（西班牙）哈布斯堡王朝统治时期逐渐融为一体。经过八十年战争（1568-1648），西班牙人最终签订了明斯特条约，正式放弃对该地的主权，荷兰至此赢得独立。[PARAGRAPH:1]八十年战争的起因是阿尔瓦公爵属下的西班牙驻军所进行的残酷宗教压迫，当时有上千名新教徒被处死，其中包括两位德高望重的贵族，激起尼德兰人的强烈不满。1568年，因遭阿尔瓦公爵迫害而自我流放的奥兰治亲王威廉返回尼德兰，发动了一场旨在推翻西班牙统治的起义。[PARAGRAPH:1]尼德兰人争取独立的战争同时也是争取信仰自由的战争，这一理念在根特协定的条文中明确地体现出来。根特协定于1576年11月8日签署，其中申明尼德兰诸省将团结一心，抛开彼此之间宗教信仰的差异，而将驱逐西班牙占领军、争取国家主权作为首要目标。[PARAGRAPH:1]在17世纪，年轻的荷兰已拥有强大的海军和商船队，在非洲沿海建立了一系列贸易据点，同时不断与葡萄牙人进行明争暗斗，控制了前往印度和印度尼西亚利润丰厚的航线。荷兰人通过一系列商业和军事冒险活动获得了大量金银财宝、商业资源和地理知识，使国家进入了文化繁荣和经济增长的黄金时代。但这样的好时光并未维持长久。[PARAGRAPH:1]法国皇帝拿破仑一世于1795年征服了荷兰本土，同时英国也在不断蚕食她的海外殖民地，荷兰在欧洲和全球的力量和影响迅速衰落。拿破仑被击败后，荷兰人恢复了部分海外领地的控制权，直到20世纪非殖民化浪潮的兴起。[PARAGRAPH:1]许多历史学家认为荷兰是世界上第一个真正的资本主义国家。荷兰人不但建立了最早的证券交易所，许多现代的金融服务――例如商业保险和退休基金――也都是荷兰人的发明。[PARAGRAPH:1]荷兰还产生了世界最早实行民主体制的公共机构之一――“水理事会”。由于荷兰独特的地理环境――半数国土均低于海平面一英尺以上――人们需要持续严密地监控其境内的所有水域，以防海水淹没土地，造成生命和财产的巨大损失。荷兰全国划分为27个“水区”，每个水区的相关事务都由该区的水理事会负责管理。这些水理事会的历史比荷兰的建国史更悠久。[PARAGRAPH:1]现今的荷兰生活着多种多样的文化族群，在对待麻醉剂、性交易、堕胎、同性婚姻和安乐死等问题上采取非常宽容的政策，因此成为不见容于其他国家的边缘性群体的避难天堂。国家鼓励各少数民族保持其独特的文化，同时又能与整个荷兰的文化融为一体，这些政策将荷兰开国先驱们曾经为之战斗牺牲的开放包容理念进一步发扬光大。</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) is an international nuclear fusion research and engineering megaproject, which will be the world's largest magnetic confinement plasma physics experiment. It is an experimental tokamak nuclear fusion reactor that is being built next to the Cadarache facility in Saint-Paul-l&#232;s-Durance, in Provence, southern France.[PARAGRAPH:2]ITER was proposed in 1987 and designed as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, according to the "ITER Technical Basis," published by the International Atomic Energy Agency, in 2002. By 2005, the ITER organization abandoned the original meaning of the acronym iter, and instead adopted a new meaning, the Latin word for "the way."[PARAGRAPH:2]The ITER thermonuclear fusion reactor has been designed to produce a fusion plasma equivalent to 500 megawatts (MW) of thermal output power for around twenty minutes while 50 megawatts of thermal power are injected into the tokamak, resulting in a ten-fold gain of plasma heating power. Thereby the machine aims to demonstrate the principle of producing more thermal power from the fusion process than is used to heat the plasma, something that has not yet been achieved in any fusion reactor. The total electricity consumed by the reactor and facilities will range from 110 MW up to 620 MW peak for 30-second periods during plasma operation. Thermal-to-electric conversion is not included in the design because ITER will not produce sufficient power for net electrical production. The emitted heat from the fusion reaction will be vented to the atmosphere.[PARAGRAPH:2]The project is funded and run by seven member entities-the European Union, India, Japan, China, Russia, South Korea, and the United States. The EU, as host party for the ITER complex, is contributing about 45 percent of the cost, with the other six parties contributing approximately 9 percent each. In 2016 the ITER organization signed a technical cooperation agreement with the national nuclear fusion agency of Australia, enabling this country access to research results of ITER in exchange for construction of selected parts of the ITER machine.[PARAGRAPH:2]Construction of the ITER Tokamak complex started in 2013 and the building costs are now over US$14 billion as of June 2015. The facility is expected to finish its construction phase in 2025 and will start commissioning the reactor that same year. Initial plasma experiments are scheduled to begin in 2025, with full deuterium-tritium fusion experiments starting in 2035. If ITER becomes operational, it will become the largest magnetic confinement plasma physics experiment in use with a plasma volume of 840 cubic meters, surpassing the Joint European Torus by almost a factor of 10.[PARAGRAPH:2]The goal of ITER is to demonstrate the scientific and technological feasibility of fusion energy for peaceful use. It is the latest and largest of more than 100 fusion reactors built since the 1950s. ITER's planned successor, DEMO, is expected to be the first fusion reactor to produce electricity in an experimental environment. DEMO's anticipated success is expected to lead to full-scale electricity-producing fusion power stations and future commercial reactors.</English>

Resurrection refers to the rules already present in vanilla RFC that allow a civilization to return if its core is controlled by independents or an unstable civilization. This effect is limited to certain periods in Dawn of Civilization, to prevent ahistorical respawns of ancient and classical civs. Also, it's not necessary to discover Nationalism to enable this mechanism, although it increases the probability of resurrections. This means that you will see resurrections occur earlier in the game. Outside of periodic checks, these resurrections can also occur when an unstable civilization collapses - if their territory includes the core of a civilization that can return, these cities will become part of this civilization instead of being independent.[PARAGRAPH:2]Dawn of Civilization also adds another mechanic that is referred to as rebirths. These are scripted and return a specific dead civ at specific dates, if certain conditions are met. Also, the faction now represents a completely new civilization with UU, UB, UP and UHV. Players can take control of these civilizations and complete their victory goals by switching to them, even if they have switched once already. Currently, this mechanic covers the rebirths of Persia as Iran, Maya as Colombia and Aztecs as Mexico.</English>

After the Solomonic restoration of Atse Yikuno Amlak I, the resurgent Emperors began to re-establish the Axumite armies. This culminated in the reign of Amda Seyon I. Ethiopian forces were armed with short and long swords such as the Seif and Gorade. The Shotel swordsmen known as Shotelai and organized in the Axurarat Shotelai comprised one of the elite forces of Amda Seyon's Imperial host. Along with the Hareb Gonda and Korem cavalry, Keste Nihb archers and Axuarat Axuarai lancers were said to be the forces that "flew through the air like the eagle and spun on the ground like the avalanche", by a contemporaneous historian.[citation needed] Shotel techniques among others included hooking attacks both against mounted and dismounted opponents that had devastating effect especially against mounted cavalry. The shotel could be used to hook and rip the warrior off the horse.

		<English>[TAB]With their colonnades and rectangular floor plans, temples are perhaps the most recognizable form of ancient Greek culture. Built to house the statue of a deity, commonly one of the twelve Olympians, a Greek temple did not typically function as a meeting place. Instead, it was used to store votive offerings, while ceremonies and sacrifices were performed outside. The Greeks exercised a large degree of cultural influence on Rome, who not only adapted many of the Greek gods and deities into their own, but also developed similar temple architecture. As a result of Greco-Roman influence, columned temples have been built widely across Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Two of the best known examples are the Parthenon in Athens and the Pantheon in Rome, both of which were later converted to churches, a fate that befell many other Greco-Roman temples.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Voyager Golden Records are two phonograph records that were included aboard both Voyager spacecraft launched in 1977. The records contain sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth, and are intended for any intelligent extraterrestrial life form, or for future humans, who may find them. The records are a sort of time capsule.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although neither Voyager spacecraft is heading toward any particular star, Voyager 1 will pass within 1.6 light-years' distance of the star Gliese 445, currently in the constellation Camelopardalis, in about 40,000 years.[PARAGRAPH:2]Carl Sagan noted that "The spacecraft will be encountered and the record played only if there are advanced space-faring civilizations in interstellar space, but the launching of this 'bottle' into the cosmic 'ocean' says something very hopeful about life on this planet." [PARAGRAPH:2]The contents of the record were selected for NASA by a committee chaired by Carl Sagan of Cornell University. The selection of content for the record took almost a year. Sagan and his associates assembled 115 images and a variety of natural sounds, such as those made by surf, wind, thunder and animals (including the songs of birds and whales). To this they added musical selections from different cultures and eras, spoken greetings in 55 ancient and modern languages, other human sounds, like footsteps and laughter (Sagan's), and printed messages from U.S. president Jimmy Carter and U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim. The record also includes the inspirational message Per aspera ad astra in Morse code.[PARAGRAPH:2]The collection of images includes many photographs and diagrams both in black and white, and color. The first images are of scientific interest, showing mathematical and physical quantities, the Solar System and its planets, DNA, and human anatomy and reproduction. Care was taken to include not only pictures of humanity, but also some of animals, insects, plants and landscapes. Images of humanity depict a broad range of cultures. These images show food, architecture, and humans in portraits as well as going about their day-to-day lives. Many pictures are annotated with one or more indications of scales of time, size, or mass. Some images contain indications of chemical composition. All measures used on the pictures are defined in the first few images using physical references that are likely to be consistent anywhere in the universe.[PARAGRAPH:2]The musical selection is also varied, featuring works by composers such as J.S. Bach (interpreted by Glenn Gould), Mozart, Beethoven (played by the Budapest String Quartet), and Stravinsky. The disc also includes music by Guan Pinghu, Blind Willie Johnson, Chuck Berry, Kesarbai Kerkar, Valya Balkanska, and electronic composer Laurie Spiegel, as well as Azerbaijani folk music by oboe player Kamil Jalilov. The inclusion of Berry's "Johnny B. Goode" was controversial, with some claiming that rock music was "adolescent", to which Sagan replied, "There are a lot of adolescents on the planet." The selection of music for the record was completed by a team composed of Carl Sagan as project director, Linda Salzman Sagan, Frank Drake, Alan Lomax, Ann Druyan as creative director, artist Jon Lomberg, Timothy Ferris as producer, and Jimmy Iovine as sound engineer.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Golden Record also carries an hour-long recording of the brainwaves of Ann Druyan. During the recording of the brainwaves, Druyan thought of many topics, including Earth's history, civilizations and the problems they face, and what it was like to fall in love.[PARAGRAPH:2]After NASA had received criticism over the nudity on the Pioneer plaque (line drawings of a naked man and woman), the agency chose not to allow Sagan and his colleagues to include a photograph of a nude man and woman on the record. Instead, only a silhouette of the couple was included. However, the record does contain "Diagram of vertebrate evolution", by Jon Lomberg, with drawings of an anatomically correct naked male and naked female, showing external organs.[PARAGRAPH:2]The pulsar map and hydrogen molecule diagram are shared in common with the Pioneer plaque.[PARAGRAPH:2]The 115 images are encoded in analogue form and composed of 512 vertical lines. The remainder of the record is audio, designed to be played at 16 2/3 revolutions per minute.[PARAGRAPH:2]Jimmy Iovine, who was still early in his career as a music producer, served as sound engineer for the project.[PARAGRAPH:2]It has been said that Carl Sagan suggested including the Beatles song "Here Comes the Sun" on the record but the record company EMI, which held the copyrights, declined. However, this was refuted by Timothy Ferris, who worked on the selection with Sagan; the song was never even considered for inclusion.</English>

His father, Avgdor Gr&#252;n, was a Zionist who inspired David that there will be someday a homeland for the Jewish people. David Ben-Gurion was at the front position of the Labor Zionist movement during the fifteen years preceding the creation of Israel. He was a strict, frugal optimist who was characterized by his commitment to the creation of a Jewish state. He stressed that Israel would "uphold the full social and political equality of all its citizens, without distinction of race, creed, or sex. " [PARAGRAPH: 1] In 1910, Ben-Gurion became an editor for the Palestine Labor Party's magazine. He signed articles as "Ben-Gurion" meaning "son of young lion." From this moment on, he was known as David Ben-Gurion. When World War I broke out in 1914, Ben-Gurion was arrested by the Turks and expelled from Palestine. He fled to Egypt, then the United States. In America, he encouraged the youth to emigrate to Palestine. In 1917, Ben-Gurion organized the Jewish Legion to fight with Britain against the Turks. In 1918, he returned to Palestine. [PARAGRAPH: 1] For the next 20 years, Ben-Gurion devoted his life to Zionism. He helped organize the Histadrut, which was the General Federation of Jewish Labor. In 1935 he became chairman of the Jewish Agency for Palestine. This organization helped Jewish immigrants settle in Palestine. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Ben-Gurion was also involved in a violent resistance when his organization cooperated with Menachem Begin's Irgun. Ben-Gurion agreed to carry out Begin's plan which was to bomb the King David Hotel in a hope to embarrass the British military. However, when the results of mass killing became obvious, he immediately called the operation off. However, Begin refused. In September of 1947 Ben-Gurion reached a comfortable agreement with the Orthodox Agudath Israel party. He sent a letter to the party promising that Shabbat would be Israel's national day of rest, there would be no civil marriages, and the Orthodox sector would be given independence in the category of religious education. [PARAGRAPH: 1] Ben-Gurion declared Israel's independence on May 14, 1948. During the first weeks of the independence, he ordered all the militias to be replaced by a national army, the IDF, or the Israel Defense Forces. In 1968, when Rafi merged with Mapai to form the Alignment, Ben-Gurion refused to follow his party. Instead, he created a new party, the National List, which won four seats in the 1969 election.

		<English>[H1]Frederick II the Great[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Prussia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1712 - 1786 AD[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Frederick was born to Frederick William I, the tyrannical and cultured King of Prussia. The king held his son in great contempt, despising him for his lack of interest in leadership and war; the younger Frederick instead preferred to study literature and the arts. At the age of 18 Frederick attempted to flee to England, but he was captured and brought back to his extremely angry father, who forced him to watch the beheading of his close friend and accomplice, Lieutenant Katz. He apparently was able to get back into his father's good graces, and several years later he married a German noblewoman at his father's request.[PARAGRAPH:2]For the next several years Frederick enjoyed the life of a wealthy man of letters. He maintained an active correspondence with various scholars from around Europe, including the brilliant French writer; Voltaire. He wrote "Anti-Machiavel," a lively refutation of Machiavelli's; "The Prince." Frederick assumed the throne of Prussia upon his father's death in 1740.[PARAGRAPH:2]Once in power, Frederick showed himself to be both a ruthless pragmatist and a brilliant campaigner. Seeking to increase the size of his empire, over the next 23 years he fought a series of wars against his neighbors, notably Austria, who was often allied with Russia and France. With the support of England he won a series of significant battles against his foes, but he was eventually worn down and soundly defeated, and Berlin was occupied by an allied Austrian-Russian army.[PARAGRAPH:2]Reportedly on the verge of suicide, Frederick was saved by the timely death of the Russian Tsarina, who was replaced by the pro-Prussian Peter III. Facing the combined power of Russia and Prussia, Austria was forced to accede to Frederick's demands and give up all claims to Upper and Lower Silesia. The two European monarchs then dismembered Poland, making Prussia the most powerful force in Europe for many years to come.[PARAGRAPH:2]Domestically, Frederick was the model of an "enlightened despot." He instituted important legal and penal reforms, created new industries, improved education, and accomplished internal improvements such as drainage projects, roads, and canals. He improved the lot of his own serfs (but did nothing to curtail the nobility's power over them).[PARAGRAPH:2]During his rule Frederick maintained his friendship with the enlightened men of Europe. His midnight soirees in Potsdam were famous for the great men they attracted. Frederick was quite famous for his sharp wit and caustic tongue; he more than held his own in their company.[PARAGRAPH:2]Frederick died in 1786, leaving Prussia more powerful and prosperous than when he first gained power. Upon his death, Frederick's nephew Frederick William II inherited the throne of Prussia.</English>

Some might be political prisoners, dissidents, or simply people who fell into bad grace with their rulers. Some might be mad - incarceration being a common way to deal with the insane before the creation of mental hospitals and sanitariums.[PARAGRAPH:1] The facilities inside jails vary widely. A jail for commoners or enemies of the state might be horrible, overcrowded dark pits that are infested with rats, while a king's prison may be indistinguishable from royal quarters, except for the small matter of which side of the door on which the guards stand.

Over time, however, it was found that such "possessions" could be treated through the use of elixirs made from plant extracts. Methods were also developed to clean and treat wounds, and set fractured bones. The ancient Greeks established the first schools to teach medical sciences circa 500 BC. The texts produced by the students of these schools, most notably Hippocrates, who is considered the father of medicine, based his theories of the human body on observation and reasoning rather than supernatural intervention.[PARAGRAPH:2]Continued study of diseases over the years, combined with the dissection and study of the human body in the 13th century, pointed out flaws in early Greek theories, and led to more accurate medical texts based on detailed analysis rather than conjecture. By the 18th century, the same methods of analysis and observation used by scientists in other fields were applied to the study of medicine. This paved the way for the increasingly effective methods of treatment and surgery that have prevailed over the last 200 years.</English>

		<English>[H1]Chandragupta II[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Emperor of the Gupta Empire[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Reigned:[\BOLD] 375 - 415 AD[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Chandragupta was one of the most powerful emperors of the Gupta empire. His rule spanned during the Gupta Empire&amp;apos;s zenith. The period of prominence of the Gupta dynasty is very often referred to as the Golden Age of India. Chandragupta II the Great was the son of the previous ruler, Samudragupta the Great. He attained success by pursuing both a favorable marital alliance and an aggressive expansionist policy. In this his father and grandfather set the precedent.[PARAGRAPH:2]Not much is known about the personal details of the great king. His mother, Datta Devi, was the chief queen of Samudragupta the Great. After Samudragupta&amp;apos;s death, Ramgupta his brother took over the throne and also married Chandragupta&amp;apos;s fiance &amp;apos;Dhruvaswamini by force. The most widely accepted details have been built upon the plot of the play &amp;apos;Devi-Chandraguptam&amp;apos; of Vishakadatta. The play is now lost but fragments have been preserved in other works (Abhinava-bharati, Sringara-prakasha, Natya-darpana, Nataka-lakshana Ratna-kosha). There even exists an Arabic work Mujmalu-t-Tawarikh which tells a similar tale of a king whose name appears to be a corruption of &amp;apos;Vikramaditya&amp;apos;. He holds a semi-mythical status in India. It is widely believed that the great poet in Sanskrit, Mahakavi Kalidasa was one of the jewels of his royal court.[PARAGRAPH:2]The fragment from Natya-darpana mentions the king Ramagupta, the elder brother of Chandragupta, surrendering his queen Dhruvaswamini to the Saka king of the Western Kshatrapas Rudrasimha III, after a defeat at the Saka king&amp;apos;s hands. To avoid the ignominy the Guptas decide to send Madhavasena, a courtesan and a beloved of Chandragupta, disguised as the queen. Chandragupta changes the plan and himself goes to the Saka King disguised as the queen. He then kills Rudrasimha and later his brother Ramagupta. Dhruvaswamini is then married to Chandragupta.[PARAGRAPH:2]We do not know what liberties Vishakadatta took with the incidents, but Dhruvadevi was indeed the king&amp;apos;s chief queen as seen in the Vaisali terracotta seal that calls her &amp;apos;Mahadevi&amp;apos; Dhruvasvamini. The Bilsad pillar inscription of their son Kumara Gupta I also refers to her as Mahadevi Dhruvadevi. A Ramagupta too is mentioned in inscriptions on Jain figures in the District Archaeological Museum, Vidisha and some copper coins found at Vidisha. The fact that the king and Dhruvadevi are the protagonists of Vishakadatta&amp;apos;s play indicates that marrying his widowed sister-in-law was not given any significance by the playwright. Later Hindus did not view such a marriage with favour and some censure of the act is found in the Sanjan copperplate inscription of Amoghavarsha I and in the Sangali and Cambay plates of the Rashtrakuta king Govinda IV.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Allahabad pillar inscription mentions the marriage of Chandragupta II the Great with a Naga princess Kuberanaga. A pillar from Mathura referring to Chandragupta has recently been dated to 388 AD.[PARAGRAPH:2]Chandragupta&amp;apos;s daughter Prabhavati, by his other queen Kuberanaga, a Naga princess, was married to the powerful Vakataka king Rudrasena II.[PARAGRAPH:2]His greatest victory was his victory over the Shaka-Kshatrapa dynasty and annexation of their kingdom in Gujarat, by defeating their last ruler Rudrasimha III.[PARAGRAPH:2]His son-in-law, the Vakataka king Rudrasena II, died fortuitously after a very short reign in 390 AD, following which Prabhavatigupta ruled the Vakataka kingdom as a regent on behalf of his two sons. During this twenty-year period the Vakataka realm was practically a part of the Gupta empire. The geographical location of the Vakataka kingdom allowed Chandragupta to take the opportunity to defeat the Western Kshatrapas once for all. Many historians refer to this period as the Vakataka-Gupta age.[PARAGRAPH:2]Chandragupta II the Great controlled a vast empire, from the mouth of the Ganges to the mouth of the Indus River and from what is now North Pakistan down to the mouth of the Narmada. Pataliputra continued to be the capital of his huge empire but Ujjain too became a sort of second capital. The large number of beautiful gold coins issued by the Gupta dynasty are a testament to the imperial grandeur of that age. Chandragupta II also started producing silver coins in the Shaka tradition.[PARAGRAPH:2]Faxian (Wade-Giles Fa-hsien) was the first of three great Chinese pilgrims who visited India from the fifth to the seventh centuries AD, in search of knowledge, manuscripts and relics. He arrived during the reign of Chandragupta II and gave a general description of North India at that time. Among the other things, he reported about the absence of capital punishment, the lack of a poll-tax and land tax. Most citizens did not consume onions, garlic, meat, and wine.[PARAGRAPH:2]Culturally, the reign of Chandragupta II marked a Golden Age. This is evidenced by later reports of the presence of a circle of poets known as the Nine Gems in his court. The greatest among them was Kalidasa, who authored numerous immortal pieces of literature including The Recognition of Shakuntala. The others were the Sanskrit grammarian Amara Sinha and the astronomer-mathematician Varahamihira.[PARAGRAPH:2]The next day after the Hindu festival Diwali is called Padwa or Varshapratipada, which marks the coronation of King Vikramaditya. The Hindu Vikram-Samvat calendar was apparently started on this day and this day is celebrated as New Year&amp;apos;s Day in Nepal where Vikram Sambat is the official calendar there, and some places in India. But, Vikram-Samvat calendar is from 57 BC. So, there was someother king by name Vikram, who started this calendar.[PARAGRAPH:2]Shak-Samvat is synchronised with the Shak-Samvat calendar, which starts around April. This calendar was initiated by Gautamiputra Satakarni who defeated the Saka king Vikramaditya, thus starting the Shalivahana era or Shaka Calendar.</English>

Many historians consider him to be a military genius. During his tumultuous lifetime Shaka caused revolutionary changes to Zulu society and profoundly altered the history of his tribe forever.[PARAGRAPH:2]Shaka was born sometime around 1787 to Chief Senzangakona of the Zulus and the woman Nandi, who was the daughter of a nearby chieftain. In his early days, Shaka served as a warrior for another local chieftain named Digiswayo. When Shaka's father died around 1816, Digiswayo helped Shaka claim the chiefdom of the Zulus for himself. Shaka then murdered his half brother to secure his new position.[PARAGRAPH:2] Once Shaka had control over the Zulu, he began a series of reforms that would transform the Zulu military into the region's most powerful fighting force. First, Shaka replaced the traditional "assegai" (a javelin-like throwing spear) with the "lklwa," a short spear intended for stabbing. He also equipped his men with larger and heavier shields. This new weaponry allowed Shaka to dramatically alter his army's battle tactics, changing the very nature of warfare in the region.[PARAGRAPH:2]Before Shaka, among the tribes of southern Africa, combat was in large ritualized. The two forces would stand apart from one-another, chanting loudly and clashing their shields while hurling their spears at each other. Eventually one side's resolve would falter and they'd retreat, leaving the other side in possession of the field. Few warriors on either side were killed, and the battles rarely provided decisive results.[PARAGRAPH:2]With his military reforms, Shaka was to change all that. Shaka taught his army to close with the opponents' forces, fighting in hand-to-hand combat, where the new weaponry and shields provided Shaka's forces with a decisive advantage over their foes. Shaka invented a tactical formation called the "buffalo horns," under which his army had large wings (or horns) extending to the right and left of the main force. The main force would engage the enemy directly, while the horns outflanked the foe on left and right. Surrounded on three sides and facing a foe armed with better weaponry and shields, few armies could stand up to the Zulu attack.[PARAGRAPH:2]With the most powerful army in the region, Shaka unleashed a reign of terror upon the unsuspecting neighboring tribes of southern Africa. Shaka began his conquests with limited forces. However, through skilled diplomacy and the judicious use of assassination, he rapidly set up a system of alliances and vassal rulers to extend his control over a wide range of territory, rapidly increasing the forces under his command. Those who opposed him were slaughtered without mercy. Within a decade tribes began migrating out of the area, fleeing the Zulus in all directions. This movement of peoples has become known as Mfecane, or "the scattering."[PARAGRAPH:2]Although a great conqueror, Shaka was not an effective domestic ruler. His brutal regime was quite unpopular, and several assassinations and coups were attempted. Eventually, one of them succeeded, and in 1828 Shaka was mortally wounded by his two half-brothers. As he lay dying, Shaka is said to have told his half-brothers that they would not rule long, and that the white men would soon take the Zulu lands. Unfortunately for the Zulus, Shaka spoke truthfully, and within seventy years the Zulu would be conquered by the British.[PARAGRAPH:2]It is interesting to speculate what would have been the result if Shaka has still been alive when the British invaded Zululand. Shaka was a great military innovator, and it's possible that he would have much earlier understood the power of the British rifles, and he might have quickly tried to adopt the weapons for his own troops. However, the fact remains that his people would still have had no industrial base and little ability to import such weapons. He might have chosen to avoid open-field battle and adopt guerilla tactics; while this would have caused the invaders much more grief, it is likely that in the end he too would have been defeated by the British military-industrial juggernaut.</English>

		<Chinese>[H1]沙卡[[ Brang] [Brut]祖鲁酋长[\Brut] [NurLang] [Brut]居住：[\Brand ] 1787 - 1828 [新行] [段落：2 ] [粗体]背景：[博尔德] [段落：1 ] Shaka是祖鲁酋长，被认为将他的部落从一个许多无足轻重的实体转变成南部非洲的恐怖。许多历史学家认为他是个军事天才。在动荡的一生中，Shaka对祖鲁社会产生了革命性的变化，深刻地改变了他部落的历史。[段落：2 ] Shaka出生于大约1787岁左右，祖鲁人的酋长和妇女Nandi，她是附近的酋长的女儿。在他早期，沙卡曾为另一个名叫迪吉斯瓦约的地方酋长当过战士。当沙迦的父亲在1816年左右去世时，迪吉斯瓦约帮助沙迦为自己夺取了祖鲁人的酋长国。Shaka随后杀害了他的同父异母兄弟以确保他的新职位。[段：2 ]一旦Shaka控制了祖鲁，他开始了一系列改革，将祖鲁军队转变为该地区最强大的战斗力量。首先，沙卡用“lklwa”代替了传统的“assegai”（一种标枪式的投掷矛），lklwa是一种用于刺伤的短矛。他还为他的部下装备了更大更重的盾牌。这种新武器使Shaka能够极大地改变他军队的作战策略，改变该地区战争的本质。[段：2 ]在Shaka之前，在非洲南部的部落中，战斗是大规模仪式化的。这两支部队会彼此分开，一边高呼口号，一边互相击打盾牌，一边向对方投掷长矛。最终，一方的决心会动摇，他们会撤退，让另一方控制着战场。几乎没有任何一方的战士被杀，战斗很少提供决定性的结果。[段落：2 ]在他的军事改革中，Shaka改变了一切。沙卡教导他的军队与对手的军队紧密合作，并肩作战，新的武器和盾牌为沙卡的军队提供了战胜敌人的决定性优势。沙卡发明了一种叫做“水牛角”的战术队形，在这种队形下，他的军队有一对大翅膀（或一对角）延伸到主力部队的左右两侧。主力部队将直接与敌人交战，而角队则左右包围敌人。在三面环抱，面对敌人装备着更好的武器和盾牌的情况下，很少有军队能够抵抗祖鲁人的攻击。[段：2 ]该地区最强大的军队，Shaka释放了南部非洲毫无疑问的邻国部落的恐怖统治。沙卡以有限的兵力开始了他的征服。然而，通过娴熟的外交手段和明智地使用暗杀手段，他迅速建立了同盟和附庸统治者的体系，将他的控制范围扩大到广泛的领土，迅速增加了他指挥下的部队。那些反对他的人被无情地屠杀了。不到十年，部落就开始迁出这个地区，向四面八方逃离祖鲁人。人们的这种运动已经被称为“MefAne”，或者“散射”（段落：2），虽然是伟大的征服者，但Shaka并不是一个有效的国内统治者。他的残暴政权相当不受欢迎，并有几次暗杀和政变企图。最终，其中一人成功了，1828年，沙卡被他的两个同父异母的兄弟致命伤了。据说，沙卡临死前告诉他同父异母的兄弟们，他们不会统治太久，白人很快就会占领祖鲁人的土地。不幸的是，对于祖鲁人来说，Shaka的话是真实的，七十年内，祖鲁人将被英国征服。[段：2 ]推测如果英国入侵Zululand时，Shaka还活着，结果会是什么样的。沙卡是一个伟大的军事创新者，他很可能早就了解英国步枪的威力，他可能很快就试图为自己的部队采用这种武器。然而，事实仍然是，他的人民将仍然没有工业基础，几乎没有能力进口这种武器。他可能会选择避免公开的野战，采取游击战术；虽然这会让入侵者更加悲痛，但很可能最终他也会被英国军工巨头击败。</Chinese>

		<English>[H1]Peter I the Great[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Emperor of All Russia[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1672 - 1725 AD[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Peter was born the fourth son of the Tsar Alexey I. After the death of his father and older brother, at the age of 10 he became co-tsar with his sickly half-brother, Ivan, under the regency of their sister Sophia Alexeevna. Apparently Peter was quite the terror in his teens. He had utter contempt for religious and political ceremony, combined with almost limitless energy and a capacity for alcohol. At 17 he had the regent (his elder sister) arrested on charges of conspiring against him and had her locked in a convent, where she would stay for the rest of her life. He took total control of the empire, his brother Ivan no more than a figurehead.[PARAGRAPH:2]In addition to drinking, carousing, and political intrigue, young Peter was also fascinated by military affairs. In 1695, he ordered the army to move against the Turks. Astonishingly, he didn't command his forces in the field, instead choosing to act as an lowly artilleryman. The Russian forces emerged victorious and within a year had captured the vital port of Azov.[PARAGRAPH:2]Several years later, Peter set off on a tour of Europe. He spent 16 months traveling incognito through Germany, Holland, England and Austria, at one time working as a shipwright in England and Holland. Peter learned a lot during his trip, and he later hired many western craftsmen, engineers, soldiers, sailors, architects and artists to help modernize Russia. Once home, Peter adopted many European customs, including a mandate that beards were to be shaved off at court, which was a great controversy that nearly caused a revolt with the Boyars.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite his love of European culture, Peter remained a drunken, overbearing bully, whose practical jokes stopped just short of outright torture. (Or perhaps went a little over the line.) Foreign observers noted with horror that at a state dinner Peter had one of his cronies hold another tight, pinning his arms and forcing his mouth open. The victim was known to hate salads and especially vinegar; Peter jammed salad into his mouth and down his throat and then poured vinegar up his nose until it bled.[PARAGRAPH:2]Peter liked to force his guests - including foreign diplomats - to drink until they passed out, then wake them up an hour later and force them to drink more. He once woke a group of extremely inebriated men up in the middle of the night, gave them axes and demanded that they help him cut down trees to make a path to the seashore.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1700 Russia went to war against Sweden. But, Gustavus Aldolphus, the Swedish King, proved more cunning to him, striking Peter's army before it was prepared, capturing much of the Russian artillery in the process. In response Peter demanded that all of the bells in Moscow (including church bells) be melted down to make cannons. He also confiscated church treasure to fuel the war effort. The war dragged on, but in 1709 the Swedish forces were decisively defeated, and Russia gained parts of Finland, Estonia, and Latvia.[PARAGRAPH:2]Peter's home life did not go particularly well. In 1698 his wife was implicated in a plot to overthrow him; he divorced her and sent her off to yet another convent. In 1712 he married his mistress, Martha Skavronsky, a former Lithuanian servant and previously the mistress of a bevey of other Russian nobles. She gave him four children. In 1718 the tsar's oldest son Alexey was imprisoned for suspected treason and died under torture.[PARAGRAPH:2]Upon his death Peter was buried in Saint Petersburg, the vital port and Russian capital, which he established in 1703, in the Peter and Paul Cathedral. Presumably under the heaviest rock they could find.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Temple of Artemis was located in the city of Ephesus in modern Turkey, and it was considered to be one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. At its grandest the building contained more than 100 marble columns (each 50 feet or more in length) and covered an area larger than the Acropolis in Athens. The first temple built on the site was finished around 600 BC, but was burned down and destroyed some 50 years later. The temple was rebuilt starting circa 550 BC, and its new incarnation was even larger and more magnificent than before. Its construction was sponsored by the Lydian king Croesus and it was designed by the Greek architect Chersiphron. The temple was decorated with bronze sculptures made by the finest artists of the era, including Phidias, Polycleitus, Kresilas, and Phradmon. It served as both a marketplace and a religious institution, drawing tourists from far and wide across Greece and the Near East.[PARAGRAPH:1]Unfortunately, the Temple of Artemis was destroyed again in 356 BC by a man named Herostratus, who deliberately committed arson in an attempt to immortalize his name (in which he obviously succeeded). Legend has it that the temple burned to the ground on the same night as Alexander the Great was born, and that Artemis was too busy attending his birth to save her temple. After Alexander's death, the Temple of Artemis was rebuilt once more, achieving its largest and most impressive size yet. Aside from its roof, the new temple was made entirely out of marble, with steps leading up to a huge terrace that measured 260 by 430 feet in size. The temple was re-adorned with statues, paintings, and other fine artwork, and over time regained its position of glory.[PARAGRAPH:1]When St. Paul visited Ephesus in the first century AD, the Temple of Artemis was still standing and its priests had no intention of renouncing their goddess. Unfortunately, the building was burned down by the Goths during a raid in 262 AD. The Ephesians vowed to rebuild it, but interest in the Hellenic gods and goddesses was beginning to wane by that point. By 400 AD, most of the people of Ephesus had converted to Christianity, and the remnants of the temple were torn down by St. John Chrysostom.

		<Chinese>阿尔忒弥斯神庙坐落于爱琴海东岸以弗所城（今土耳其境内），是古代西方世界七大奇观之一。在其规模最宏大的时候，神庙主殿竖立着上百根大理石柱，每根高50英尺（15米）以上，占地面积比雅典卫城更大。在此位置上的第一座神庙建成于公元前600年左右，但约50年后遭到焚毁。后在前550年左右完成重建，重建后的神庙比原先那座更为宏伟壮丽。新神庙由吕底亚王克利萨斯出资建造（他的名字现在已是“大富豪”的同义词），由希腊建筑师伽尔瑟夫农主持设计。神庙中所装饰的青铜雕塑均出自当时最杰出的艺术家之手，包括菲迪亚斯、波里克里托斯、克雷西拉斯和福雷德蒙。除作为宗教活动场所外，神庙广场还兼作贸易集市，吸引着希腊和近东地区的大批访问者。[PARAGRAPH:2]不幸的是，阿尔忒弥斯神庙在公元前356年又被一个名叫希罗斯特图斯的疯子再次焚毁，他蓄意纵火以使自己能够名留史册（好吧，显然他确实做到了）。传说神殿化作焦土之夜亦即亚力山大降生之时，阿尔忒弥斯女神因忙于照料他的出世而未能顾及自己的神庙。在亚力山大去世之后，阿尔忒弥斯神庙再获重建，益发彰显其规模之宏大、结构之美妙。除顶部之外，第三座神庙完全由大理石构筑，附以层层台阶一路升叠，通向长260英尺、宽430英尺的广阔月台。神殿以雕像、绘画及其他精美艺术品修饰一新，往日的荣光又再度重现。[PARAGRAPH:2]公元1世纪圣保罗到访以弗所的时候，阿尔忒弥斯神庙依旧巍然矗立，神庙的祭司们多年以来从未想与他们的女神背渎相离。可惜天不遂人愿，这座建筑在公元262年的哥特人入侵中被焚毁殆尽。以弗所人曾誓言要再度恢复其原貌，但是从那一刻起，希腊诸神在尘世的影响力已开始日渐衰落。到公元400年的时候，大多数的以弗所居民都已皈依基督教，残存的建筑也在圣约翰·克里索斯托姆的号召下被彻底拆除（他将其视作异教世界力量的象征）。其中的大理石被移往其他的建筑，时至今日，阿尔忒弥斯神庙遗迹已是荡然无存矣。[PARAGRAPH:2]</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]Krak des Chevaliers ("fortress of the knights" in a mixture of Arabic and French) was the headquarters of the Knights Hospitaller in Syria during the Crusades. The castle is located east of Tripoli in the Homs Gap, atop a 650-meter high hill along the only route from Antioch to Beirut and the Mediterranean Sea. It is one of many fortresses part of a defensive network along the border of the old Crusader states.[PARAGRAPH:2]The original fortress had been built in 1031 for the emir of Aleppo. It was captured by Raymond IV of Toulouse early in 1099, during the First Crusade, but was abandoned when the Crusaders continued their march to Jerusalem. It was reoccupied again by Tancred, Prince of Galilee, in 1110. Raymond II, count of Tripoli, gave it to the Hospitallers in 1144. The Hospitallers rebuilt it and expanded it into the largest Crusader fortress in the Holy Land, adding an outer wall 3 meters thick with seven guard towers 8-10 meters thick, to create a concentric castle. One of these towers was occupied by the Grand Master of the Hospitallers. In the 12th century there was a moat covered by a drawbridge leading to postern gates.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1163, the fortress was unsuccessfully besieged by Nur ad-Din. After their victory the Hospitallers became an essentially independent force on the Tripolitanian frontier. By 1170, the Hospitallers' modifications were complete, but parts of the fortress were rebuilt after numerous earthquakes in the late 12th century and early 13th century. It is estimated that the castle fortress could hold 50-60 Hospitallers and up to 2,000 foot soldiers. Aside from the control of the road to the Mediterranean, the Hospitallers also exerted some influence over Lake Homs to the east, where they could control the fishing industry and watch for Muslim armies gathering in Syria.[PARAGRAPH:2]Another failed siege was made by Saladin in 1188, during which the castle general was captured. He was taken by Saladin's men to the castle gates where he was told to order the gates opened. He first told his men in Arabic to surrender the castle, then in French told them to hold the castle to the last man.</English>

		<English>[H1]J锟絲ef Klemens Pilsudski[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prime Minister of Poland[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1867 - 1935 AD[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]J锟絲ef Klemens Pilsudski was a Polish statesman; Chief of State (1918-22), "First Marshal of Poland" (from 1920), and de facto leader (1926-35) of the Second Polish Republic, Minister of Military Affairs. From mid-World War I he had a major influence in Poland's politics, and was an important figure on the European political scene. He was the person most responsible for the creation of the Second Republic of Poland in 1918, 123 years after it had been taken over by Russia, Austria and Prussia. Under Pilsudski, Poland recovered Vilnius from newly born independent state of Lithuania following Zeligowski's Mutiny but was unable to incorporate most of Lithuania into the newly resurrected Polish State.[PARAGRAPH:2]Describing himself as a descendant of the culture and traditions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Pilsudski believed in a multicultural Poland - a home of nations, recognizing numerous ethnic and religious nationalities and finally existing in strong historical alliance with independent states of Lithuania and Ukraine. His main opponent Roman Dmowski by contrast called for an independent state of Poland narrowed to the lands of historical Crown and founded mainly on ethnically Polish demos and Roman Catholic identity.[PARAGRAPH:2]Early in his political career, Pilsudski became a leader of the Polish Socialist Party. Concluding that Poland's independence would have to be won by force of arms, he created the Polish Legions. In 1914 he anticipated the outbreak of a European war, the Russian Empire's defeat by the Central Powers, and the Central Powers' defeat by the western powers. When World War I broke out, he and his Legions fought under Austrian army control against Russia. In 1917, with Russia faring badly in the war, he withdrew his support from the Central Powers and was arrested by the Germans.[PARAGRAPH:2]From November 1918, when Poland regained independence, until 1922 Pilsudski was Poland's Chief of State. In 1919-21 he commanded Poland's forces in six border wars that shaped the nation of Poland. His forces seemed almost defeated in the Polish-Soviet War when they fought the battle for Warsaw in August 1920. In the "miracle on the Vistula," they routed five Russian armies and saved Poland. In 1923, with the government dominated by his opponents, particularly the National Democrats, he withdrew from active politics. Three years later, he returned to power with the May 1926 coup d'锟絫at, and became the strong man (in practice a military dictator) of Poland. From then until his death in 1935, he concerned himself primarily with military and foreign affairs.[PARAGRAPH:2]Pilsudski pursued, with varying degrees of intensity, two complementary strategies, intended to enhance Poland's security: "Prometheism", which aimed at breaking up, successively, the Imperial Russia and later the Soviet Union into their constituent nations; and the creation of an "Intermarium" federation, comprising Poland and other independent states located in the geographical space between the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea and geopolitically placed between Germany and Russia. The Intermarium main purpose was to guarantee a lasting balance of power in Central Europe and to secure the existence of its nations against both western and eastern imperialisms.[PARAGRAPH:2]Between 1945 and 1989, Pilsudski's person and his record were one of the multiple topics forbidden by the Polish communist regime. Wandycz characterizes him as "an ardent Polish patriot who on occasion would castigate the Poles for their stupidity, cowardice, or servility. He called himself a Polish Lithuanian, and was stubborn and reserved, loath to show his emotions." Today, although some aspects of his rule remain controversial, Pilsudski's memory is held in high esteem in Poland. Together with his opponent Roman Dmowski he is regarded as a father of the modern Polish nation.</English>

Because using a bow requires a horseman to let go of the reins with both hands, horse archers need superb equestrian skills. Horse archery is typically associated with steppe nomads.[PARAGRAPH:1]The weapon of choice for horse archers was the recurve bow, because it was compact enough to shoot from a horse and retained sufficient range and penetrating power. The most serious threat to horse archers was arrows, and they could wheel away out of bowshot after every attack. Mounted archers therefore needed little or no armor and could ride light, fast mounts such as ponies. This made them cheap to equip and increased their strategic mobility.[PARAGRAPH:1]A drawback of horse archers was that the movements of a running horse disturbed the accuracy of the shot. After the invention of the stirrup, horse archers would stand up in their stirrups to absorb the motion of the horse. Another method to facilitate accurate shooting was to time shots between the strides of the horse.[PARAGRAPH:1]Horse archers were eventually made obsolete by the development of modern firearms.</English>

In one storm alone, seventy ships were lost off the east coast of Scotland. The Scottish engineer Robert Stevenson had proposed the construction of a lighthouse on Bell Rock in 1799, but cost concerns and the relatively radical nature of the proposal by a young engineer caused it to be shelved. The loss of the warship HMS York and all on board in 1804 resulted in a furore in Parliament. Stevenson sent his design to John Rennie who approved the design and costing. Rennie's reputation led to legislation being passed in 1806 enabling construction to begin.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Northern Lighthouse Board awarded the contract to design and build to John Rennie, with Stevenson being appointed as chief assistant. The design was based on the earlier Eddystone Lighthouse designed by John Smeaton, which Stevenson had inspected in 1801, and which was also built on an offshore reef using interlocking stones. It also contained newer features, such as rotating lights alternating between red and white designed by the carpenter Francis Watts. Stevenson was totally responsible for construction and his written account of the work gave little or no credit to Rennie. "The apportionment of responsibility for this work led to prolonged disputes between their respective descendants, but it is now certain that while Stevenson designed the lighthouse in the main, Rennie's role too was significant."</English>

The town of Bougie was then the most notorious pirate base.[PARAGRAPH:1]Several events influenced the growth of the pirates. The conquest of Granada by the Catholic sovereigns of Spain drove many Moors into exile. They revenged themselves by piratical attacks on the Spanish coast. They had the help of Muslim adventurers from the Levant, of whom the most successful were Hizir and Oruc, natives of Mitylene. Spain in self-defense began to conquer the coast towns of Oran, Algiers and Tunis. Oru&#231; having fallen in battle with the Spaniards in 1518, his brother Hizir appealed to Selim, the sultan of Turkey, who sent his troops. He drove the Spaniards in 1529 from the rocky island in front of Algiers, where they had a fort, and was the founder of the Turkish power.</English>

In the middle of the 19th century, scientists were looking for an inexpensive synthetic substance that could be used to replace natural materials which were expensive and difficult to procure. For example, ivory was used in many goods - utensils, fans, piano keys, and so forth. Ivory was attractive and comfortable to the touch, but it was becoming very expensive as the animal populations were depleted.[PARAGRAPH:2]A plastic-like substance called "parkesine" was created in England in 1862, but the material proved unsatisfactory; it became very brittle in a short period of time. In 1863 an American inventor named John Hyatt discovered a way to improve the flexibility and longevity of parkesine; he called his new product "celluloid." Celluloid first gained widespread use as a material for making shirt cuffs and collars; but it soon spread into other areas, including as a material for making movie and photographic film.[PARAGRAPH:2]Over time, more advanced plastics were created; these would see use as everything from fabric to eyeglass lenses to artificial hearts.

It is a coincidence that his regnal number (III) was the same for both Orange and England. As King of Scotland, he is known as William II. He is informally and affectionately known by sections of the population in Northern Ireland and Scotland as "King Billy".[PARAGRAPH:2]William inherited the principality of Orange from his father, William II, who died a week before William's birth. His mother Mary, Princess Royal, was the daughter of King Charles I of England. In 1677, he married his mother's fifteen year old niece and his first cousin, Mary, the daughter of his maternal uncle James, Duke of York.[PARAGRAPH:2]A Protestant, William participated in several wars against the powerful Catholic king of France, Louis XIV, in coalition with Protestant and Catholic powers in Europe. Many Protestants heralded him as a champion of their faith. In 1685, his Catholic father-in-law, James, became king of England, Ireland and Scotland. James's reign was unpopular with the Protestant majority in Britain. William, supported by a group of influential British political and religious leaders, invaded England in what became known as the "Glorious Revolution". On 5 November 1688, he landed at the southern English port of Brixham. James was deposed and William and Mary became joint sovereigns in his place. They reigned together until her death on 28 December 1694, after which William ruled as sole monarch.[PARAGRAPH:2]William's reputation as a strong Protestant enabled him to take the British crowns when many were fearful of a revival of Catholicism under James. William's final victory at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 is still commemorated by the Orange Order. His reign in Britain marked the beginning of the transition from the personal rule of the Stuarts to the more Parliament-centred rule of the House of Hanover.</English>

His every need was catered to, and he was given an excellent education, even if he was too lazy and spoiled to appreciate it. Louis XIII died when his son was five, and the regency passed to the queen mother, Anne of Austria. For the next 18 years she ruled France with the able assistance of Cardinal Mazarin, who may or may not have also been her lover, while Louis lived in pampered splendor.[PARAGRAPH:2]It was upon Mazarin's death in 1661 that the 22-year-old Louis XIV began to take an active interest in ruling his country. Much to everyone's surprise, he was good at it. First he gathered all of the power into his own hands, bypassing the old bureaucratic patronage system that Mazarin and his predecessors had used. He enticed the great nobles to his court, where he heaped upon them titles, honorary positions, and financial rewards, while at the same time undermining their actual power. In Louis' court, great noblemen - whose parents had fought for the crown of France itself - fought each other for the privilege of watching Louis shave.[PARAGRAPH:2]In person Louis was said to possess a great natural dignity and bearing. He was unfailingly courteous and usually honest, but he could dissimulate with the best of them when need-be.[PARAGRAPH:2]During his early reign Louis's court was known for its debauchery, and Louis himself had several mistresses. As his reign progressed, however, Louis became more devout, and he even married his last mistress (although in secret). Louis also became a patron of the arts, and literature and painting flourished under his rule. He built many great buildings and palaces, including the grand palace at Versailles.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite France's wealth, the country remained virtually bankrupt, not only because it had to pay for all the gifts that Louis gave his favorites, but, more importantly, it had to pay for all the wars of conquest that Louis embarked upon. Although a sound and thoughtful ruler at home, Louis had a great thirst for international "glory" - which in his terms meant victory on the battlefield. He constantly fought his neighbors, often for the most trivial reasons, gaining little but glory from the wars. Though he left the army and navy in splendid condition, he left his country's treasury bare.[PARAGRAPH:2]Louis XIV died after ruling France for 72 years.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Hinduism is considered to be the oldest religion still in practice. Its roots can be traced back to the Rig-Veda, a collection of over 1000 religious hymns written about 3500 years ago in Sanskrit. Today Hinduism has approximately one billion followers, most concentrated in the Indian subcontinent.[PARAGRAPH:2]Hinduism believes that man needs to strive for self-realization in order to once again become part of the Ultimate Reality, which is God. All things are God - each man suffers only because he has forgotten that. Until he remembers, his soul remains in bondage, and he must suffer the eternal cycle of death and rebirth into this world.[PARAGRAPH:2]Perhaps the most interesting part of Hindu thought is that there is no one true path to self-realization. Any kind of spiritual practice followed with faith and love will lead one to this enlightenment. Hindus have a rich pantheon of deities, all of whom are but a different aspect of the one God. Many contemporary Hindus believe in a Holy Trinity, consisting of Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, and Shiva the Destroyer - all are equal, all are faces of the One. Other Hindus have different interpretations, some citing one god as God and others as subordinates.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite these differences, there is little conflict between the various schools of thought. For, as Krishna, avatar of Vishnu, said, "Whatever deity or form a devotee worships, I make his faith steady." </English>

		<English>[TAB]The Terracotta Army is a collection of terracotta sculptures depicting the armies of Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. It is a form of funerary art buried with the emperor in 210-209 BC and whose purpose was to help guard his empire in his afterlife.[PARAGRAPH:1]The figures, dating from 3rd century BC, were discovered in 1974 by some local farmers in Lintong District, Xi'an, Shaanxi province, near the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor.[PARAGRAPH:1]The figures vary in height, according to their roles, with the tallest being the generals. The figures include warriors, chariots, horses, officials, acrobats, strongmen and musicians. Current estimates are that in the three pits containing the Terracotta Army there were over 8,000 soldiers, 130 chariots with 520 horses and 150 cavalry horses, the majority of which are still buried in the pits.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Terracotta Army was discovered in the spring of 1974 to the east of Xi'an in Shaanxi Province by a group of farmers when they were digging a water well 1.5 miles (2.4 km) north of Mount Li (Lishan), a region riddled with underground springs and watercourses. For centuries, there were reports of pieces of terracotta figures and fragments of the Qin necropolis - roofing tiles, bricks, and chunks of masonry - having been occasionally dug up in the area. This most recent discovery prompted archaeologists to investigate, and they unearthed the largest pottery figurine group ever found in China. In 195 B.C., Liu Bang - the first emperor of the dynasty that followed the Qin - had ordered that 'twenty households' should move to the site of the mausoleum of the First Emperor of Qin (Shi Huangdi, "Shi Huangdi" means the first emperor) to watch over the tomb. To this day, twenty villages sit in the immediate vicinity of the mausoleum, one of them the hamlet where those who made the discovery lived.[PARAGRAPH:1]In addition to the warriors, an entire man-made necropolis for the emperor has also been found. Qin Shi Huangdi's necropolis complex was constructed as a microcosm of his imperial palace or compound. It consists of several offices, halls, stables and other structures placed around the tomb mound which is surrounded by two solidly built rammed earth walls with gateway entrances. Up to 5 meters (16 feet) of reddish, sandy soil had accumulated over the site in the centuries following its construction, but archaeologists found evidence of earlier disturbances at the site. During the digs at Mount Li, archaeologists found several graves dating from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, where diggers had apparently struck terracotta fragments which were then discarded as worthless back into the back-filled soil.[PARAGRAPH:1]According to historian Sima Qian (145-90 BC), work on this mausoleum began in 246 BC soon after Emperor Qin ascended the throne (then aged 13), and the full construction later involved 700,000 workers. Geographer Li Daoyuan, six centuries after the death of the First Emperor, recorded in Shui Jing Zhu that Mount Li was a favoured location due to its auspicious geology: "... famed for its jade mines, its northen side was rich in gold, and its southern side rich in beautiful jade; the First Emperor, envious of its fine reputation, therefore chose to be buried there". Sima Qian, in his most famous work, Shiji, completed a century after the mausoleum completion, wrote that the First Emperor was buried with palaces, towers, officials, valuable artefacts and wonderful objects. According to this account, there were 100 rivers simulated with flowing mercury, and above them the ceiling was decorated with heavenly bodies below which were the features of the land. Some translations of this passage refer to "models" or "imitations," those words however weren't used in the original text.[PARAGRAPH:1]Recent scientific work at the site has found high levels of mercury in the soil of the tomb mound, giving some credence to Sima Qian 's account of the emperor's tomb. The tomb mound is located at the foot of Mount Li as an earthen pyramid, and the tomb of Shi Huangdi appears to be a hermetically sealed space that is as big as a football pitch and located underneath the pyramid. The tomb remains unopened, one possible reason may be concerns about the preservation of valuable artifacts once the tomb is opened. For example, the painted surface of the terracotta army began to flake and fade once they have been excavated. Later historical accounts suggested that the tomb had been looted by Xiang Yu, a contender for the throne, five years after the death of the emperor, however there are indications that the tomb may not have been plundered.[PARAGRAPH:1]Only a portion of the site is presently excavated, and photos and video recordings are prohibited in some viewing areas. Only a few foreign dignitaries, such as Queen Elizabeth II, have been permitted to walk through the pits to observe the army at close quarters.</English>

The electromagnetic force of attraction and repulsion between various substances is due to the motion of positively and negatively charged electrons. Every magnet has positive and negative sides, called poles. Poles with a like charge repel one another, and poles with opposite charges attract one another.[PARAGRAPH:2]The study of magnetic phenomena soon showed that a free-floating magnet aligns itself with the Earth's magnetic field, one pole pointing north, the other south.

As the son of the most powerful monarch in the "civilized" world, Alexander got the best of everything, including education - the scholar Aristotle, the great thinker of Western Civilization, was his tutor.[PARAGRAPH:2]Taught by his mother that he was descended from Hercules and Achilles, Alexander did not lack for self-confidence, even at a very young age. At 16 he led an army to quell a Thracian rebellion while his father was away. Alexander stormed the rebel stronghold and broke the back of the rebellion.[PARAGRAPH:2]Several years later, Alexander's father was assassinated while in the process of mounting an invasion of Persia. Alexander immediately took power, and within two years he carried out his father's interrupted invasion of Persia. Alexander's force consisted of 30,000 foot soldiers and 5,000 cavalrymen, a huge army for the day, and was accompanied by engineers, surveyors, scientists, and even historians.[PARAGRAPH:2]Alexander had amazing success against the Persians. He repeatedly beat their best soldiers, routinely fighting against odds of 10-to-1. His success can be attributed to his military genius, his force's superb training and equipment, and their magnificent esprit de corps, largely engendered by their faith in Alexander's invincibility.[PARAGRAPH:2]Having secured Persia's surrender, Alexander then moved south, conquering Syria, Palestine, much of modern Iraq, and eventually Egypt herself. He returned to Persia, destroyed the last of the Persian forces and took over the entire country. He continued east, eventually coming into contact with the great Indian King Porus, who fought him to a standstill. Alexander eventually won the conflict, but at such a heavy cost that his men begged him to end the campaign and let them return to their families. Alexander himself returned to rule his empire from the captured city of Babylon.[PARAGRAPH:2]In eight short years of fighting, Alexander had conquered more territory than any other living being. He successfully led his forces into battle against all of the great nations of the day, but none could stand against him. He was the absolute ruler of the largest empire the world had ever seen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Apparently he found this boring.[PARAGRAPH:2]Once in Babylon, Alexander began an inexorable decline. He began drinking heavily and engaging in all kinds of available debauchery (and there was much debauchery to be found in Babylon). He became subject to fits of anger and bouts of paranoid delusion. One night, in a fit of blind rage and under the influence of alcohol, Alexander murdered Clitus, his closest associate. This barbaric act was to haunt Alexander for the rest of his life - which wasn't very long.[PARAGRAPH:2]In June of 323 BC, his body weakened by his excesses, Alexander died of malaria. He was 32 years old. </English>

		<English>[TAB]Confucianism is an East Asian religion based upon the teachings of Confucius. Confucius (known in Chinese as Kong Fu Zi) lived between 552 and 479 BC. Confucius lived in China during an especially turbulent period, when the country lacked central leadership and various small states fought constantly for dominance. As much a philosopher and political theorist as a religious leader, Confucius sought to teach others the correct behavior for man in society. His philosophy emphasized personal and governmental morality and strong family loyalty. He believed that each man had a place in society, and that each should behave righteously and correctly according to that place. This included the ruler, who needed to be devoted to the people rather than to personal aggrandizement.[PARAGRAPH:2]Confucianism grew in influence for the two centuries following Confucius' death, until it was rigidly suppressed during the Qin Dynasty, whose leaders saw it as a threat to their power. The Qin systematically destroyed the Confucian temples and burned all the Confucian books, including most of Confucius' writings. Virtually everything was lost, except for a cache of important books hidden in the walls of a believer's home. When these were discovered, the few remaining believers were able to rebuild and spread their religion. Eventually Confucianism became the state religion of China. It remained so until the Communists came into power in the 20th Century.[PARAGRAPH:2]Today, Confucianism is enjoying something of a revival, and many Chinese students (and students from around the world) study the great philosopher and his teachings. However, in modern times Confucianism is mostly studied as a philosophy rather than a religion (though it should be pointed out that there is no clear distinction between the two in Eastern thought).</English>

		<English>[TAB]Before the spread of Islam and the Arabic language, the term "Arab" referred to any of the nomadic residents of the Arabian Peninsula. When used in a modern context, "Arab" refers to any of the Arabic-speaking peoples who reside on the Atlantic Coast of Africa, Southwestern Iran, Egypt, Sudan, Saudi-Arabia, Syria, and Iraq.  The earliest nomadic inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula herded their sheep, goats, and camels through an unforgiving desert environment; while those Arabs who settled in the oases provided date and cereal agriculture as trade staples for Arab caravans that transported spices, ivory, and gold from southern Arabia and the Horn of Africa to the civilizations farther north.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the 7th century AD, Muhammad emerged as the prophet for the religion of Islam, which was widely adopted by the Arab community. Islam unified the Bedouins and the town-dwellers of the oases, and within a century, spread throughout most of the present day Arab-speaking world. The newfound social organization that followed Islam offered new possibilities for the Arabs as agricultural production and intercity trading, particularly in luxury goods, saw significant increases. Gradually, the triad of temple, court, and market formed, as well as a standardized style of writing for laws and other texts. New institutions also emerged, including coinage, territorial deities, royal priesthoods, and standing armies, which further enhanced Arab power.[PARAGRAPH:2]By proclaiming his message publicly, Muhammad gained many followers. After his death, the succeeding caliphs continued to spread the faith of Islam far beyond the religion's birthplace in Mecca. Aside from initial conquests in Iraq and Syria, the Arab conquests penetrated regions including Anatolia, Northern Africa, and Iran. Using their Camel Archers to cross difficult desert terrain, the Arabs were able to create an empire stretching from Spain to the borders of India in barely more than a hundred years. The Arab empire of the medieval period was far more advanced than contemporary Europeans; Harun al-Rashid's Baghdad may have held a million people at the same time that Charlemagne's Aachen was a "capital" of ten thousand. Centers of learning attracted scholars from across the Muslim world to great cities such as Baghdad, Damascus, and Cordoba. The Arabs of this period made many advances in medicine, astronomy, mathematics, and other areas, as well as translating many of the classics of the Ancient Greeks into Arabic, thereby saving them from destruction.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the period of the Crusades, the Arabic world came under assault from Christian Europe. The greatest of Muslim generals from this period was Salah al-Din, better known as Saladin, who successfully defeated the Third Crusade and recaptured Jerusalem for the Arabs. In addition to his military skills, Saladin was known to be a pious man and was well-respected by his enemies as well as his allies - which was very unusual indeed for the Crusades.[PARAGRAPH:2]For most of the past five centuries, much of the Arab world has been ruled by foreigners; first by the Ottoman Turks, then by the Western colonial powers. Since the onset of de-colonization in the 1950s, traditional Arab values have been modified through the combined pressures of urbanization, industrialization, and Western influence.  While urban Arabs still tend to identify themselves more by nationality than by tribe, village farmers revere the pastoral nomad's romantic way of life and claim a kinship with the great desert tribes of the past.  As heirs to the ancient Egyptians, Babylonians, Persians, Hebrews, even to the Greeks and Indians, the societies created by Muslims bridge time and space.  The original Arab tribes, in less than 20 years after Muhammad's death, defeated the Byzantine and Persian empires, occupied a vast territory from Libya to Persia, and then developed into the Arab, or Islamic, Empire known today.</English>

		<Chinese>远在伊斯兰教和阿拉伯语的大规模向外传播以前，“阿拉伯”一词仅指阿拉伯半岛上的游牧民族。但在现代文献中，则可能涵盖所有说阿拉伯语的人，他们遍布北非地中海沿岸，伊朗西南部、埃及、苏丹、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚以及伊拉克。最早的生活在阿拉伯半岛上的游牧民族在严酷的沙漠环境中驯养绵羊、山羊、骆驼等，另一些定居者则生活于各个绿洲，种植椰枣和谷物，他们组成大规模的商队与来自阿拉伯半岛南部，东部非洲之角以及遥远北方文明的文明交换香料，象牙和黄金。[PARAGRAPH:2]公元七世纪时，先知穆罕默德开始宣讲伊斯兰教义并获得阿拉伯人的广泛接受。伊斯兰教将在沙漠中游牧的贝都因人和在绿洲里生活的居民团结在一起，仅用一个世纪时间就转遍了现今的整个阿拉伯语地区。伊斯兰教改变了阿拉伯世界的社会组织形式，促使农业生产和城市间贸易特别是奢侈品贸易更为迅速地发展。寺院、宫殿和市场大量兴建，撰写法律文书和其他各种文献的迫切需要则促成了阿拉伯书面文体的统一。一系列新的社会机构和制度也开始形成，包括：货币制度、地方与中央的专门神职机构以及常备军制度，这一切大大增强了阿拉伯人的力量。[PARAGRAPH:2]穆罕默德通过向大众宣讲教义而获得大批信徒（“穆斯林”）。公元632年穆罕默德去世之后，接替其担任穆斯林领袖的人被称为“哈里发”，历代哈里发以麦加为中心继续向四方传播伊斯兰教。在征服伊拉克与叙利亚之后，穆斯林军队又进入了安纳托利亚、努比亚、利比亚和伊朗。阿拉伯骆驼骑射手部队在沙漠地形中畅行无阻，仅用大约一百年的时间就建立了西起西班牙，东至印度边境的大帝国。中世纪的阿拉伯帝国比同时期的欧洲要先进得多，哈伦·阿尔-拉施德统治下的巴格达人口可能达到一百万，而当时查理曼帝国都城亚琛的居民不过一万而已。巴格达、大马士革和科尔多瓦等城市也成为聚集了穆斯林世界众多智者的学术中心。这一时期阿拉伯人在医学，天文学，数学及其他领域都取得了大量研究成果，他们还将许多古希腊的经典著作翻译成阿拉伯文，使其免于湮没无闻的命运。[PARAGRAPH:2]在十字军东征期间，阿拉伯世界遭遇来自欧洲基督教国家的侵扰。这一时期最著名的一位穆斯林军事领袖是萨拉赫·阿尔-丁，欧洲人称他为萨拉丁，他成功击败了第三次十字军东征，并为阿拉伯人收复了耶路撒冷。萨拉丁不但军事能力出众，而且具有仁慈宽宏的高尚人格，因而赢得了盟友甚至敌人对他的一致尊敬——这种情况在十字军东征的年代是极为罕见的。[PARAGRAPH:2]在过去的五个世纪里，阿拉伯世界的大部分地区均为异族所统治，先是奥斯曼土耳其人，然后则是西方列强。20世纪50年代非殖民化浪潮开始之后，阿拉伯人的传统价值观在20世纪随着都市化，工业化和西方文化的不断影响已经开始改变。虽然城市里的居民仍倾向与对整个阿拉伯民族的认同而不局限于本部落，乡村里的居民则趋向于回归浪漫的游牧生活，并宣称他们的血统传承自伟大的远古沙漠部落。是古埃及人、巴比伦人、波斯人、希伯来人，甚至希腊人和印度人的后代，穆斯林们创建的社会组织成为沟通如此广阔时间和空间的桥梁。当初微不足道的阿拉伯各部落在穆罕默德去世后不到20年的时间里连续击败了拜占庭和波斯两大帝国，控制了从利比亚到波斯的辽阔土地，建立起后世所称道的阿拉伯伊斯兰帝国。</Chinese>

A reconstruction was installed in the Catherine Palace between 1979 and 2003.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Amber Room was intended in 1701 for the Charlottenburg Palace, in Berlin, Prussia, but was eventually installed at the Berlin City Palace. It was designed by German baroque sculptor Andreas Schl&#252;ter and Danish amber craftsman Gottfried Wolfram. Schl&#252;ter and Wolfram worked on the room until 1707, when work was continued by amber masters Gottfried Turau and Ernst Schacht from Danzig. It remained in Berlin until 1716, when it was given by the Prussian King Frederick William I to his then ally, Tsar Peter the Great of the Russian Empire. In Russia, the room was expanded, and after several renovations, it covered more than 55 square metres (590 sq ft) and contained over 6 tonnes (13,000 lb) of amber.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Amber Room was looted during World War II by the Army Group North of Nazi Germany, and brought to K&#246;nigsberg for reconstruction and display. Its current whereabouts remain a mystery. In 1979, efforts were undertaken to rebuild the Amber Room at Tsarskoye Selo. In 2003, after decades of work by Russian craftsmen and donations from Germany, the reconstructed Amber Room was inaugurated at the Catherine Palace.</English>

Legends of his conquests are pervasive throughout history, and he is considered one of the great figureheads of European Chivalric society.[PARAGRAPH:2]During his lifetime Charlemagne successfully campaigned in many countries. Some wars he completed personally and others were left for his sons to finish. His first campaign was against Desiderius of Lombardy who, soon after the succession of Pope Hadrian I, marched on Rome. Charlemagne pressed into Lombardy, and after a lengthy siege (772-774), he accepted Desiderius' unconditional surrender. Desiderius would live out the remainder of his life confined to a monastery.[PARAGRAPH:2]The longest lasting and most challenging conquest of Charlemagne's reign would be that of Saxonia. It would be a theater that he would continually revisit during his lifetime. After Charlemagne's initial push into Saxonia he was continuously forced to retake previously conquered land which had rebelled against his authority. Weary of war and losing more rights and freedoms with every capitulation, the Saxons eventually accepted Charlemagne's terms, including renouncement of their national religious customs and adoption of the Christian faith and its associated Frankish customs.[PARAGRAPH:2]Charles was both a highly religious man and a philanthropist. He often built friendly relationships with other countries, such as Egypt and India, so that he could later send money in an effort to assist struggling Christians in those regions. Although much more of a conqueror than an economic or social reformer, Charles often contributed money to relieve the poor and sick in his kingdom.[PARAGRAPH:2]Charlemagne, despite being unable to write well himself, had a vast love of literature and education. Due to his conquests, Charlemagne came into contact with many different cultures and learning institutions. Having contributed considerable funding to existing monastic schools and institutions of learning, Charlemagne's era became known as the Carolingian Renaissance, with a blossoming of the arts and sciences.[PARAGRAPH:2]As a member of the Nine Worthies, a group of both fictional and real people that represented the pinnacle of chivalry during their eras, Charlemagne was the embodiment of honor in both person and position.

At fourteen he was commissioned as a sub-lieutenant in an artillery regiment. When the French revolution broke out, Napoleon sided with the Revolutionaries and was appointed lieutenant-colonel of artillery, where he quickly made a name for himself as a successful commander. By 1794 he was a brigadier-general, and by 1795 he was appointed command of the French Army of the Interior. He was 25 years of age.[PARAGRAPH:2]Over the next few years Napoleon led French armies, in defense of the new Republic, to major victories over various continental foes, including the extremely powerful Austrians. In 1798 Napoleon sailed against Egypt where he won great land victories; however, the British navy destroyed the French fleet in Egypt, crippling his force. In 1800 Napoleon abandoned his weakened army and returned to France.[PARAGRAPH:2]Napoleon found Paris in a state of political turmoil, which he quickly took advantage of by overthrowing the government and making himself First Consul, with dictator-like power over all of France. An exceptional administrator, he rapidly reorganized the government, repealed the more radical and violent laws of the Revolution, and reopened the churches, gaining the love and respect of the French people, exhausted by years of revolution and chaos.[PARAGRAPH:2]However, France was still at war with most of Europe, and Napoleon once again took to the battlefields, where he won stunning victories against Austria, causing that country and England to make peace. In celebration Napoleon quickly declared himself Emperor and consol for Life.[PARAGRAPH:2]England remained nervous of France's imperial intentions, and war resumed in 1803, with England destroying French shipping on the sea and France putting together a great invasion fleet in the unsuccessful hope of occupying the British Isles. Other countries were equally alarmed by France's actions and they joined the English. France soon found itself facing a daunting alliance that included England, Austria, Russia and Sweden. Acting with amazing speed and cunning, Napoleon used his "interior lines" to concentrate his forces against the dispersed enemy. He rapidly marched across Europe, capturing the capital of Austria and then crushing the Russian forces at the battle of Austerlitz. Austria sued for peace once again, this time giving up all territory in Italy and along the Adriatic.[PARAGRAPH:2]For several more years Napoleon would defeat every foe that came against him. He moved his forces with unbelievable alacrity, and he was always able to bring them against the enemy's weakest spot. He crushed the Prussians, the Spanish, and the Austrians yet again. He tried to improve his political position by marrying his various relatives into the great families of Europe, with minor success.[PARAGRAPH:2]Eventually Napoleon decided that he would never be safe in Europe as long as Russia, aided by the perfidious English, was on his flank, so he led half a million men to Moscow. The Russian forces retreated before his advance, taking or burning anything that might be of use to the invaders, while in the rear Cossack raiders destroyed his supply lines. He did reach and capture Moscow, but once again the Russians had removed or burnt anything there that might feed his men. By September he was forced to retreat, his army reduced to 120,000 weary and starving men. By the end of November his forces had been further reduced to 20,000. Napoleon had lost 96%% of his army.[PARAGRAPH:2]Upon returning to Paris, Napoleon immediately recruited another army of 350,000, but his image of invulnerability was gone and all Europe rose against him. Prussia, Russia and Austria allied against him. England threw more troops into contested Spain. Though Napoleon was to again win famous victories, his enemies sensed victory and continued their relentless attacks. Eventually the allies drove their way into Paris, and Napoleon abdicated. For his trouble he was given ruler ship of the island of Elba, along with an income of six million francs, to be paid by France.[PARAGRAPH:2]But this wasn't enough for Napoleon. Ten months later he re-entered France. The populace immediately went over to his side and he quickly regained his power and titles. He raised an army of 125,000 and headed to Belgium, where an English and Prussian force awaited him. At Waterloo, Napoleon was finally and irrevocably defeated by the English/Prussian forces under the leadership of English general Wellington. This time he was confined for life at the island of Sainte-H&#233;l&#232;ne, a thousand miles from the coast of Africa. He died there in 1821.[PARAGRAPH:2]Napoleon was one of the most brilliant generals of all time. He moved his troops with astounding rapidity, and he always knew exactly where to strike in order to cause the most damage. He turned out to be a decent ruler and France flourished under his control (until his endless wars sapped her strength and will to fight). His only major flaw was his unending drive for conquest and domination, driving other powers to oppose him for their own preservation. In the end, he just couldn't beat everybody. </English>

It was the organizing principle of rural economy that originated in the Roman villa system of the Late Roman Empire, and was widely practiced in medieval western and parts of central Europe. It was slowly replaced by the advent of a money-based market economy and new forms of agrarian contract. Manorialism was characterised by the vesting of legal and economic power in a Lord of the Manor, supported economically from his own direct landholding in a manor (sometimes called a fief), and from the obligatory contributions of a legally subject part of the peasant population under the jurisdiction of himself and his manorial court. These obligations could be payable in several ways, in labor (the French term corv&#233;e is conventionally applied), in kind, or, on rare occasions, in coin.</English>

Pericles was born in 495 BC in the Greek city state of Athens to the wealthy Alcmaeonid family. Though he later went on to lead Athens through the Peloponnesian war, he spent the majority of his early life in quiet study. It is believed that his studies in philosophy greatly influenced his later political career, and Pericles would use his influence with the Athenian people to further promote the arts and literature.[PARAGRAPH:2]Pericles debuted on the political stage in 472 BC when he sponsored the Persae of Aeschylus, a popular tragedy, during the spring festival of Dionysus. This cemented his position as a wealthy and influential man in the minds of the citizens, and gave him the influence necessary to assist in breaking up the Areopagus, a traditional council of wealthy landowners that ruled over Athens, and later to banish Cimon - one of his key political rivals.[PARAGRAPH:2]Some scholars have attributed several of the democratic institutions created by Pericles to the eventual downfall of Athens. The Athenian democratic structure was fundamentally flawed - in order to sustain their high quality of life the Athenians would need to subjugate other city states for the tribute they could provide. In the short term, however, this system helped create a powerhouse economy that threatened Sparta and eventually sparked the Peloponnesian war.[PARAGRAPH:2]Following a heavily defensive strategy, Pericles convinced the people to avoid direct confrontation with Sparta and its allies in favor of quick raids and overseas attacks which would make use of Athens's superior navy. The end result of the campaign would never be seen, as in 430 BC, just two years after the start of the war, a plague broke out in Athens, decimating the population and claiming the lives of Pericles' legitimate children and, eventually, his own.</English>

One account of its discovery tells that lightning struck a chedi in Wat Pa Yia (Bamboo Forest Monastery, later renamed Wat Phra Kaew) in Chiang Rai, revealing a Buddha covered with stucco inside. The Buddha was then placed in the abbot's residence, who later noticed that stucco on the nose had flaked off, revealing a green interior. The abbot removed the stucco and found a Buddha figure carved from a green semi-precious stone, which became known as Phra Kaew Morakot or in English the Emerald Buddha. ("Emerald" refers to its "green colour" in Thai, not its composition.) Some art historians describe the Emerald Buddha as belonging to the Chiang Saen Style of the 15th century AD, which would mean it is of Thai Lanna origin.[PARAGRAPH:2]King Sam Fang Kaen of Lanna wanted it in his capital, Chiang Mai, but the elephant carrying it insisted, on three separate occasions, on going instead to Lampang. This was taken as a divine sign, and the Emerald Buddha stayed in Lampang in a specially-built temple (now Wat Phra Kaeo Don Tao) for the next 32 years. In 1468, it was moved to Chiang Mai by King Tiloka, where it was kept in a niche in a large stupa called Chedi Luang.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Emerald Buddha remained in Chiang Mai until 1552, when it was taken to Luang Prabang, then the capital of the Lao kingdom of Lan Xang. Some years earlier, the crown prince of Lan Xang, Setthathirath, had been invited to occupy the vacant throne of Lanna as his mother was the daughter of the king of Chiang Mai who had died without a son. However, Prince Setthathirath also became king of Lan Xang when his father, Photisarath, died. He returned home, taking the revered Buddha figure with him.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1564, King Setthathirath moved it to Vientiane, which he had made his new capital due to Burmese attacks and where the Buddha image was housed in Haw Phra Kaew. The Buddha image would stay in Vientiane for the next 214 years.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1779, the Thai General Chao Phraya Chakri put down an insurrection, captured Vientiane and took the Emerald Buddha to Siam. It was installed in a shrine close to Wat Arun in Thonburi, its new capital. Chao Phra Chakri then took over the reins and founded the Chakri Dynasty of Rattanakosin Kingdom. He adopted the title Rama I and shifted his capital across the Menam Chao Phra river to its present location in Bangkok, and constructed the new Grand Palace including Wat Phra Kaew within its compound. Wat Phra Kaew was consecrated in 1784, and the Emerald Buddha was moved with great pomp and pageantry to its current home in the ubosot of the Wat Phra Kaew temple complex on 22 March 1784.</English>

Much effort was made in Venice to make these galleasses as fast as possible to compete with regular galleys.

The galleass exemplified an intermediate type between the galley and the true man-of-war. Relatively few galleasses were built - one disadvantage was that, being more reliant on sails, their position at the front of the galley line at the start of a battle could not be guaranteed - but they were used at the Battle of Lepanto (7 October 1571), their firepower helping to win victory for the Christian fleet, and some sufficiently seaworthy galleasses accompanied the Spanish Armada in 1588 (e.g. La Girona). In the 15th century a type of light galleass, called the frigate, was built in southern European countries to answer the increasing challenge posed by the north African based Barbary pirates in their fast galleys.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the Mediterranean, with its shallower waters, less dangerous weather and fickle winds, both galleasses and galleys continued in use, particularly in Venice and Turkey, long after they became obsolete elsewhere.

Later, specific buildings were constructed to house theatres.[PARAGRAPH:1] Modern theatres are similar in layout to the earliest buildings. The audience sits or stands facing a stage; behind the stage is an extensive backstage area holding sets, props, dressing rooms and so forth. The primary difference between stages of Shakespeare's time and modern theaters is that the latter have electrical systems allowing them to light the stage as needed and to amplify the actors' voices.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Citizenship describes the legal codification of the relationship between a state and its people. Instead of being just being a subject at the whim of the power of their ruler, the status of citizen comes with certain rights and obligations towards the state. The prime example of citizenship was the Roman Republic. Initially, only inhabitants of Rome could be citizens, which came with access to the Roman legal system, protection from enslavement, and political participation. Over the course of Roman history citizenship was gradually expanded to other populations under Roman rule, which furthered their integration into Roman society.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]The concept of citizenship continued during the Roman Empire and entered the Western legal tradition. During the Middle Ages, citizenship was replaced by serfdom as the dominant form of social relationship, however the practice continued in independent cities. Modern European states, and later almost all states in the world, conferred citizenship to all its peoples for essentially the same reason the Roman Republic did.</English>

		<Chinese>[表]公民权是指国家与其人民之间关系的法律法典化。公民的地位不只是统治者一时兴起的一个主体，而是伴随着对国家的某些权利和义务而来。罗马共和国是公民身份的主要例子。最初，只有罗马的居民才能成为公民，公民可以进入罗马的法律体系，免受奴役和政治参与。在罗马历史的进程中，公民权逐渐扩展到罗马统治下的其他人群中，这进一步促进了他们融入罗马社会。在中世纪，公民身份被农奴制取代，成为社会关系的主要形式，但这种做法在独立的城市中仍在继续。现代欧洲国家，以及后来几乎世界上所有国家，赋予其所有人民公民权的原因基本上与罗马共和国相同。</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]The history of coffee begins in the 9th century. It is thought to have originated in the highlands of Ethiopia and spread to the rest of the world via Egypt and Europe. The word coffee is derived from the Arabic word Qah'wa, over Ottoman Turkish Kahve, which originally meant wine or other intoxicating liquors. Partly due to the Islamic prohibition on drinking alcohol, preparing and drinking coffee became an important social ritual. In the 15th century, Muslims introduced coffee in Persia, Egypt, northern Africa and Turkey, where the first cafeteria, Kiva Han, opened in 1475 in Constantinople. The stimulant effect of drinking coffee caused it to be forbidden among orthodox and conservative imams in Mecca in 1511 and in Cairo in 1532 by a theological court. In Egypt, coffeehouses and warehouses containing coffee cherries were sacked. But the product's popularity, particularly among intellectuals, led to the reversal of this decision in 1524 by an order of the Ottoman Turkish Sultan Selim I. From the Muslim world, coffee spread to Europe, where it became popular in the 17th century. Dutch traders were the first to start large scale import of coffee into Europe.</English>

		<Chinese>咖啡的历史始于9世纪。它被认为起源于埃塞俄比亚高原，并通过埃及和欧洲传播到世界其他地区。咖啡这个词来源于阿拉伯语单词Qah'wa，而不是土耳其的土耳其卡夫，它最初的意思是葡萄酒或其他令人陶醉的酒。部分由于伊斯兰禁止饮酒，准备和喝咖啡成为一种重要的社会仪式。15世纪，穆斯林在波斯、埃及、北非和土耳其引进咖啡，1475年在君士坦丁堡开设了第一家自助餐厅Kiva Han。1511年在麦加和1532年在开罗，一个神学法庭禁止正统和保守的伊玛目喝咖啡。在埃及，咖啡馆和存放咖啡樱桃的仓库被洗劫一空。但是这种产品的流行，特别是在知识分子中的流行，导致了1524年土耳其奥斯曼苏丹塞利姆一世（Selim I）下令推翻这一决定。咖啡从穆斯林世界传播到欧洲，并在17世纪风靡欧洲。荷兰贸易商率先开始向欧洲大规模进口咖啡。</Chinese>

There is often a religious justification for such hereditary rule; monarchs are said to rule by "divine right" or "the mandate of heaven." A monarch's power can be absolute but is often partially delegated to officials or nobles - in some cases so much that the monarch is little more than a figurehead.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]The strength of monarchy is that there is usually a clear line of succession and, due to its institutional nature, even dynastic changes can be relatively stable. Furthermore, there may be a certain amount of familial pressure on the ruler to not ruin the ancestral legacy for the next generation. However, monarchy suffers the same kind of weaknesses as do all unelected rulers; the leader is not answerable to the people, and it can be extremely difficult to get rid of a bad one.  History records many great monarchs but also many more that failed to inherit the same virtues as their forebearers.</English>

		<English>[H1]Lorenzo de' Medici[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Ruler of Florence[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1449 - 1492 AD[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Lorenzo di Medici was destined to a brief but intense life that would go down in the history of Florence and Italy. He was one of the great leaders of the Italy of his time, which precisely in Florence witnessed on extraordinary flowering of intellectual activities. He was a politician, a man of power and culture.[PARAGRAPH:2]Lorenzo began his public life very early and he succeeded his father when he was not yet twenty-one. Immediately he had to face difficult situations such as financial problems, conspiracies, relations with the Papacy, with Kings princes and milers of the countries. Nevertheless slowly the "balance of power" that Lorenzo maintained with Milan, Venice and Naples reinforced the Florentine position, and wise economic measures improved the family finances. But Lorenzo's genius went further than this: he continued his family's traditional patronage of artists, opening his house and gardens to the younger ones. First Leonardo then Michelangelo and many others such as Botticelli, Filippino Lippi etc. turned to him for aid and protection.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1485, Girolamo Savonarola, a Dominican from the convent of San Marco began to seduce the Florentines with his prophetic language. He spoke of the Apocalypse and of the dreadful God, first from the pulpit of San Marco and then from that of the cathedral. Although it had been Lorenzo who had brought the Dominican back from exile in Bologna, Savonarola's preaching soon took on a tone of implacable accusation against his benefactor.[PARAGRAPH:2]The friar accused Lorenzo publicly and unequivocally of ruining the state and squandering the wealth of the people deposited in the public coffers. Those who attempted to appease the spirit of the friar received the answer, "I do not care. But let (the Magnificent) know that I am a foreigner and he is a citizen and the first of the city: I am to stay and he is to go: I shall stay and not he." Many saw in these words a prophesy of Lorenzo's death, like the lightning-bolt that had struck Brunelleschi's dome a few months before his death. Accounts of this last meeting between Lorenzo the Magnificent and Savonarola, differ, but one may suppose, or hope, that in the end the friar remembered above all his duties as a priest. Lorenzo died peacefully in the night between April 8 and 9, 1492 in the Villa of Careggi. Florence was deeply shaken by his death which left an immense void in the world.[PARAGRAPH:2]Two years after Lorenzo's death his eldest son Piero, called the "unfortunate", was exiled from Florence for his political "incapacity" and only after 18 years the Medici family could return to its home-town.</English>

Where capacity is sufficient a single quay constructed along the land adjacent to the water is normally used; where there is a need for more capacity many wharves will instead be constructed projecting into the water, as with the well known collection of wharves in San Francisco. A pier, raised over the water rather than within it, is one type of wharf, commonly used for cases where the weight or volume of cargos will be low.[PARAGRAPH:2]Smaller and more modern wharves are sometimes built on flotation devices (pontoons) to keep them at the same level to the ship even during changing tides.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Kingdom of Kongo was a former state in western Central Africa, founded in the 14th century. In the 15th century the kingdom stretched from the Congo River in the north to the Loje River in the south and from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to beyond the Kwango River in the east. Several smaller autonomous states to the south and east paid tribute to it. Kongo was ruled by the manikongo, or king, and was divided into six provinces, each administered by a governor appointed by the manikongo.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1482, Diogo Cao, a Portuguese explorer, visited the kingdom, and the reigning manikongo, Nzinga Nkuwu, was favorably impressed with Portuguese culture. In 1491, Portuguese missionaries, soldiers, and artisans were welcomed at Mbanza-Kongo, the capital of the kingdom. The missionaries soon gained converts, including Nzinga Nkuwu (who took the name Joao I), and the soldiers helped the manikongo defeat an internal rebellion.[PARAGRAPH:2]The next manikongo, Afonso I (reigned 1505-43), was raised as a Christian and attempted to convert the kingdom to Christianity and European ways. However, the Portuguese residents in Kongo were primarily interested in increasing their private fortunes (especially through capturing Africans and selling them into slavery), and, despite the attempts of King Manuel I of Portugal to channel the efforts of his subjects into constructive projects, the continued rapaciousness of the Portuguese played a major part in weakening the kingdom and reducing the hold of the capital over the provinces.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the death of Afonso, Kongo declined rapidly and suffered major civil wars. The Portuguese shifted their interest southward to the kingdom of Ndongo and helped Ndongo defeat Kongo in 1556. However, in 1569 the Portuguese aided Kongo by helping to repel an invasion from the east by a Lunda ethnic group. The slave trade, which undermined the social structure of Kongo, continued to weaken the authority of the manikongo.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1641, Manikongo Garcia II allied himself with the Dutch in an attempt to control Portuguese slave traders, but in 1665 a Portuguese force decisively defeated the army of Kongo and from that time onward the manikongo was little more than a vassal of Portugal. The kingdom disintegrated into a number of small states, all controlled to varying degrees by the Portuguese. The area of Kongo was incorporated mostly into Portuguese Angola and partly into the Kongo Free State (under control of Belgium). Today the territory is made up by Northern Angola, the western part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (Congo-Kinshasa, former Zaire) and southern Republic of the Congo (Congo-Brazzaville).</English>

Tt was constructed from wood and wicker-work, with one-piece iron rims for the wheels (probably a Celtic invention). Another Celtic innovation was the free-hanging axle, suspended from the platform with rope and possibly even with a leather suspension system. This resulted in a much smoother and controlled ride on rough terrain.[PARAGRAPH:1]Julius Caesar provides the only significant eyewitness report of Celtic chariot warfare: "Their mode of fighting with their chariots is this: firstly, they drive about in all directions and throw their weapons and generally break the ranks of the enemy with the very dread of their horses and the noise of their wheels; and when they have worked themselves in between the troops of horse, leap from their chariots and engage on foot. The charioteers in the meantime withdraw some little distance from the battle, and so place themselves with the chariots that, if their masters are overpowered by the number of the enemy, they may have a ready retreat to their own troops. Thus they display in battle the speed of horse, together with the firmness of infantry; and by daily practice and exercise attain to such expertness that they are accustomed, even on a declining and steep place, to check their horses at full speed, and manage and turn them in an instant and run along the pole, and stand on the yoke, and thence betake themselves with the greatest celerity to their chariots again."</English>

In modern major cities, the department store made a dramatic appearance in the middle of the 19th century, and permanently reshaped shopping habits, and the definition of service and luxury. Similar developments were under way in London (with Whiteleys), in Paris (Le Bon March&#233; in 1852) and in New York (with Stewart's).[PARAGRAPH:2]Department stores today have sections that sell the following: clothing, furniture, home appliances, toys, cosmetics, houseware, gardening, toiletries, sporting goods, do it yourself, paint, and hardware and additionally select other lines of products such as food, books, jewelry, electronics, stationery, photographic equipment, baby products, and products for pets. Customers check out near the front of the store or, alternatively, at sales counters within each department. Some are part of a retail chain of many stores, while others may be independent retailers.

		<English>[TAB]Jungle or Tropical forest refers to the dense, more or less impenetrable tropical rainforest biome with an abundance of animal and plant life. The term jungle is technically a synonym to Tropical Rainforest. The word jungle originates from the Sanskrit word jangala which referred to uncultivated land. Although the Sanskrit word refers to "dry land", it has been suggested that an Anglo-Indian interpretation led to its connotation as a dense "tangled thicket", while others have argued that a cognate word in Urdu did refer to forests. The term is prevalent in many languages of South Asia, and Iranian plateau, particularly in Bangla, Hindi, Marathi, Urdu, Punjabi and Persian.</English>

		<English>[TAB]During the Middle Ages sword technology improved, and the sword became a very advanced weapon. It was frequently used by men in battle, particularly during an attack. The spatha type remained popular throughout the Migration period and well into the Middle Ages. Vendel Age spathas were decorated with Germanic artwork (not unlike the Germanic bracteates fashioned after Roman coins). The Viking Age saw again a more standardized production, but the basic design remained indebted to the spatha.[PARAGRAPH:2]Around the 10th century, the use of properly quenched hardened and tempered steel started to become much more common than in previous periods. The Frankish 'Ulfberht' blades (the name of the maker inlaid in the blade) were of particularly consistent high quality. Charles the Bald tried to prohibit the export of these swords, as they were used by Vikings in raids against the Franks.[PARAGRAPH:2]Wootz steel which is also known as Damascus steel was a unique and highly prized steel developed on the Indian subcontinent as early as the 5th century BC. Its properties were unique due to the special smelting and reworking of the steel creating networks of iron carbides described as a globular cementite in a matrix of pearlite. The use of Damascus steel in swords became extremely popular in the 16th and 17th centuries.[PARAGRAPH:2]It was only from the 11th century that Norman swords began to develop the crossguard (quillons). During the Crusades of the 12th to 13th century, this cruciform type of arming sword remained essentially stable, with variations mainly concerning the shape of the pommel. These swords were designed as cutting weapons, although effective points were becoming common to counter improvements in armour, especially the 14th-century change from chain mail to plate armour.</English>

The name Asvaka/Asvakan or Assaka is said to be derived from Sanskrit Asva or Prakrit Assa and it literally denotes someone connected with the horses-hence: a horseman, or a cavalryman or "breeder of horses". The Asvakas were especially engaged in the occupation of breeding, raising and training war horses, as also in providing expert cavalry services to outside nations, hence they also constituted an excellent class of Kshatriyas (warriors).

His four decades of rule marked the greatest expansion of the Byzantine Empire since its split with the Roman Empire and a sweeping revival in the Christian religion.[PARAGRAPH:2]Born in a small village in modern Macedonia, Justinian had little connection to power in Constantinople as a youth. It was the rise of his uncle, Justin, a Byzantine general who succeeded the Emperor Anastasius, which drew young Justinian from the Macedonian pastures into cosmopolitan Constantinople. Justinian served his uncle as a close advisor for a decade before the passing of Emperor Justin transferred the diadem to Justinian.[PARAGRAPH:2]With Justinian's rise to power, two other important faces rose to prominence. Belisarius, a close friend of Justinian, became the leader of Justinian's armies and proved himself as a brilliant tactician. The second face belonged to his beautiful and savvy wife, Theodora, who took on the role that Justinian himself once filled, that of the emperor's closest advisor.[PARAGRAPH:2]One of Justinian's first actions as Emperor was to order a collection of all Roman law, the Corpus Juris Civilis. But not long after the first issuing of the Corpus, an uprising among two rival chariot racing factions, the Blues and the Greens, engulfed Constantinople in a wave of violence and conflagration. Enterprising powers within the city allied against Justinian, using the chaos to declare a new Emperor, Hypatius, a nephew of Anastasius. Justinian, unsure of the strength of usurpers, decided to flee the city, but his brave wife refused. Instead, Belisarius was ordered to take two divisions and quell the uprising, which he did with ruthless ability, trapping rioters in the Hippodrome and killing nearly 30,000 before the riot was finally put down.[PARAGRAPH:2]The damage done to the city after the riots was substantial. Among the smoldering ruins lay the Hagia Sophia, Constantinople's greatest cathedral, burnt to the ground. Justinian thus began a monumental campaign to expand and restore the building. With its completion five years later, the reconstructed Hagia Sophia was christened as the world's largest cathedral, a title it would hold for a millennium. Under Justinian's order, twenty-five cathedrals were built in Constantinople alone, with many more built outside the capital city.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Empire thrived under Justinian. Thanks in no small part to the able command of Belisarius, Emperor Justinian's reach spread from Constantinople to Southern Spain, with North Africa and Italy all falling under the Byzantine grasp. Justinian's reign marked a high point for the Byzantine Empire, as shortly after his death, much of the land conquered in his name was lost. War with powerful Germanic tribes and neighboring Persia would cost the empire much of its hard-fought gains.</English>

In its few years of existence the Internet has dramatically changed the way that information is gathered and transmitted, and the network's full potential cannot be guessed.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Internet was first conceived of in the early 1960s.  At that time the discussion was purely theoretical, as the computers, the connections, and the common language did not yet exist. Given that it was the height of the Cold War, neither did the necessary international cooperation. But the idea had many supporters, especially in universities and research labs around the US, and by 1969 four computers located around the country were in communication with each other through ARPA-Net.[PARAGRAPH:1]By the mid-1980s, the core of the network was in place, the communications protocols had been determined, and the Internet was live. By the early 1990s the first Internet language (http) was written and the first browser was published. The World Wide Web was born.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Internet stands today as one of the few great projects constructed largely by individuals rather than by an organization such as a corporation, religion, or government. Various portions of the network were indeed created and funded by the US Department of Defense - but much of it came together organically, built in bits and pieces by professors, scientists and engineers, perhaps less for personal gain than because they thought the "information society" was an idea worth pursuing. </English>

		<English>[TAB]The area which encompasses modern Portugal was originally settled by Celtic tribes around 1000 BC and was then subsequently conquered by the Visigoths and finally the Moors. The Christian Kings of Asturia eventually drove the Moors out of the area; the new nation of Portugal was formed after its separation from Spanish rule.[PARAGRAPH:2]Portugal was one of the first great internationally-based sea empires in the European world. Between 1415 and 1665, Portugal created a series of resting and refueling ports along the eastern and western coasts of Africa in a bid to eventually reach the profitable shores of India. In 1498 they achieved their goals when Vasco da Gama reached Kozhikode (known then as Calicut). Several important battles took place between the Arabs (who had previously monopolized spice trade in the Indian Ocean) and the Portuguese during this era, the most important of them being the victory over the Egyptian-Gujarati fleet off of Diu in 1509. This victory assured the Portuguese maritime superiority in the Indian Ocean and enabled them to capitalize on the rich spice trade routes between India and Europe. However, in 1578 King Sebastian of Portugal was killed at the battle of "Field of the Three Kings" in Morocco (which Portugal had long hoped to conquer), along with the majority of his force, destroying a central part of Portugal's land armies.[PARAGRAPH:2] In 1580 the throne of Portugal was given over to the Habsburg kings of Spain, partially a result of the Portuguese weakness after the demise of its own king. At the same time, Portuguese power in both the east and west was declining due to a lack of skilled sailors available in Portugal. The English and the Dutch had also been amassing large navies, and began expanding their spheres of influence along routes traditionally held solely by the Portuguese. Although the Portuguese wrested national control back from the Spanish in a 1640 revolt, they lost their control in Malacca, Ceylon, Cochin, Hormuz, among many others to the Dutch or other seafaring nations. With their eastern territories diminishing, Brazil, discovered by Pedro Alvares Cabral in 1500, became increasingly important.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gold was discovered in Brazil in 1690, which had previously been exploited mostly for its dyewood, sugar, diamonds, tobacco and slaves. The ensuing gold rush boosted the population of Brazil from 200,000 in 1650 to 1.5 million in 1770. Brazil today remains the largest Portuguese-speaking country in the world.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1808, French troops under Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Portugal, forcing the prince regent, Dom Jo&#227;o, to flee to Brazil and set up a new government. In 1821, the royal family moved back to Portugal after reclaiming the country. Dom Jo&#227;o stayed behind, and then his son, Dom Pedro I, ruled Brazil until the country broke away from its mother country, declaring independence in 1822.[PARAGRAPH:2]After losing Brazil, Portugal focused on building its African acquisitions in order to compete with their British and French counterparts. However, after World War II, the majority of European nations began abandoning their outlying colonies. India forcibly retook the Portuguese colonies still in their territory. In 1974, a democratic government was established in Portugal. This new government negotiated the release of its African holdings, which were promptly devastated by civil war and vicious in-fighting generated by the Cold War.[PARAGRAPH:2]Today Portugal is ruled from its capital in Lisbon as a democratic republic under the constitution of 1976. It remains an important participant in the European Union as well as one of the major environmental reformers of Europe.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Mughal Empire was an Indian-Islamic imperial power that ruled a large portion of the Indian subcontinent which began in 1526, invaded and ruled most of South Asia by the late 17th and early 18th centuries by forming alliance with Indian Maharaja, and ended in the mid-19th century. The Mughal Emperors were descendants of the Timurids, and at the height of their power around 1700, they controlled most of the Indian Subcontinent extending from Bengal in the east to Balochistan in the west, Kashmir in the north to the Kaveri basin in the south. Its population at that time has been estimated as between 110 and 130 million, over a territory of over 4 million sq.km (1.5 million square miles).[PARAGRAPH:2]The "classic period" of the Empire started in 1556 with the accession of Jalaluddin Mohammad Akbar, better known as Akbar the Great. It ended with the death of Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707, although the Empire continued for another 150 years. During this period, the Empire was marked by a highly centralized administration connecting the different regions. All the significant monuments of the Mughals, their most visible legacy, date to this period which was characterised by the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic and architectural results.[PARAGRAPH:2]Following 1725 the empire declined rapidly, weakened by wars of succession, agrarian crises fueling local revolts, the growth of religious intolerance, the rise of the Maratha, Durrani, and Sikh empires and finally British colonialism. The last king, Bahadur Zafar Shah II, whose rule was restricted to the city of Delhi, was imprisoned and exiled by the British after the Indian Rebellion of 1857.[PARAGRAPH:2]The name Mughal is derived from the original homelands of the Timurids, the Central Asian steppes once conquered by Genghis Khan and hence known as Moghulistan, "Land of Mongols". Although early Mughals spoke the Chagatai language and maintained Turko-Mongol practices, they were essentially Persianized. They transferred the Persian literature and culture to India, thus forming the base for the Indo-Persian culture.</English>

		<English>[H1]The Great Christian Schism[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]Similar to Protestantism, Catholicism is founded by a special event and does not require only a technology. This event is referred to as the Great Schism. It can be triggered in two different ways. After any civilization has first adopted Orthodoxy as its state religion, Catholicism will be founded as soon as there are more Orthodox cities outside of civilizations with Orthodox state religion than within their control. A common scenario for this is the collapse of the Roman civilization, which often leaves many Orthodox cities under independent control (who have no state religion). This represents the establishment of an independent Papacy after most of Christendom slips out of control of secular rulers (historically, the Byzantine Empire). In this case, the largest previously Orthodox city not under Orthodox control becomes the new Catholic holy city.[PARAGRAPH:2]In case this scenario never comes to pass, the Great Schism will also be triggered by the first civilization to build an Orthodox Cathedral without controlling the Orthodox holy city. This represents how more powerful religious leaders emerge outside of the traditional center of Orthodoxy and begin to establish their own separate tradition. In this case, the city with the Cathedral also becomes the Catholic holy city.[PARAGRAPH:2]In either situation, cities convert from Orthodoxy to Catholicism (including buildings) if they are closer to the Catholic than to the Orthodox holy city. An exception are cities under the control of civilizations with Orthodox  state religion (in the first scenario) or within the same civilization as the Orthodox holy city (in the second scenario), which will always remain Orthodox.</English>

In 1638 Bishop John Wilkins wrote A Discourse Concerning a New World and Another Planet, in which he predicted a human colony on the Moon. Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (1857-1935), among others, also suggested such a step. From the 1950s onwards, a number of concepts and designs have been suggested by scientists, engineers and others.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1954, science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke proposed a lunar base of inflatable modules covered in lunar dust for insulation. A spaceship, assembled in low Earth orbit, would launch to the Moon, and astronauts would set up the igloo-like modules and an inflatable radio mast. Subsequent steps would include the establishment of a larger, permanent dome; an algae-based air purifier; a nuclear reactor for the provision of power; and electromagnetic cannons to launch cargo and fuel to interplanetary vessels in space.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1959, John S. Rinehart suggested that the safest design would be a structure that could "[float] in a stationary ocean of dust", since there were, at the time this concept was outlined, theories that there could be mile-deep dust oceans on the Moon. The proposed design consisted of a half-cylinder with half-domes at both ends, with a micrometeoroid shield placed above the base.</English>

		<English>[TAB]There can be little doubt that, had they been able to overcome their internal divisions, the Poles would have been a dominant power in the Middle Ages. The first institution that can be called a Polish kingdom or nation arose in around 980 AD, when a tribal leader named Mieszko united three major tribes in eastern Europe and converted to Catholicism. The concept of a dynasty had not yet caught on in that part of Europe, though, so successions were often extremely violent and chaotic. After Mieszko's rule, the fortunes of the Polish nation-state depended entirely on the ruthlessness and strength of will of its leader. Some of Mieszko's successors were strong and able to impose their wills on the fractious principalities and tribes of Poland and Pomerania, and thereby defend effectively against foreign, usually German or Bohemian, invasion. Others were not.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1226 AD, just over two hundred years after Boleslaw II successfully reunited the Polish kingdom, Poland was deeply divided once again. Baltic tribes menaced the north and the German state of Brandenburg sought greater land and influence in the west. The Polish king, Conrad of Mazovia, decided to import an army to fight off both of these threats in exchange for an indefinite homeland in Poland. The army was the Teutonic Knights. They accepted Conrad's offer and, after arriving in northern Poland, waged several bloody campaigns of conquest against the German and Baltic occupiers. To Conrad's surprise, though, the Knights then decided that they would rather have their own country rather than a dependent homeland inside someone else's kingdom. Conrad had saved the Polish kingdom from outside invasion, only to be invaded from within.[PARAGRAPH:2]Future Polish kings then had to deal not just with Germans, Bohemians and Lithuanians, but the restless and aggressive Teutonic Knights. As if that were not enough, in 1241 a major Mongol invasion force arrived in Silesia (southeastern Poland). The Poles were able to defeat the Mongols, but at huge cost. Vast lands were laid waste and thousands of soldiers perished. In 1330 tensions between the Teutonic Knights and Poland erupted into open war, and after many political and military stalemates, the Polish king Casimir III was able to expand and recover from the Mongol attack and the endless conflicts with Poland's neighbors. But despite holding firm, Casimir had to settle for survival rather than prosperity.[PARAGRAPH:2]The golden age of Poland came at the end of the Middle Ages, when alliance with Lithuania led to a combined assault on the Teutonic Knights that culminated in the fated battle of Grunwald in 1410. The Knights were able to fight off one contingent of the allied force, but were crushed by the other. The Knights were not totally defeated, but they would never again exert their will upon Poland as forcefully as they had in the preceding two centuries. Casimir IV, perhaps the greatest Polish king, was able to capitalize on this success to unite the Polish succession lines with those of Hungary and Bohemia, creating, albeit briefly, an eastern European super-state that dominated the region culturally and militarily for two generations.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Indo-European, Ural-Altaic, and other races have occupied what is now the territory of Russia since 2000 BC, but little is known about their institutions and activities. Modern Russia dates from about 770 AD, when Viking explorers began an intensive penetration of the Volga region. From bases in estuaries along the eastern Baltic, Scandinavian bands, probably in search of new trade routes to the east, began to penetrate territory populated by Finnish and Slavic tribes, where they found unlimited natural resources.[PARAGRAPH:2]Within a few decades the Rus, as the Viking settlers were known, together with other Scandinavians operating farther west, extended their raiding activities down the main river routes toward Baghdad and Constantinople, reaching the Black Sea in 860. In the period from 930 to 1000, the region came under complete control by the Rus from their capital at Kiev. The lifeblood of this sprawling Kievan empire was the commerce organized by these Viking princes. Sometime around 1000 the Kievan princes were converted to Christianity by Byzantine missionaries, and the medieval Russian states would maintain close cultural ties with the Byzantines. The united Kievan state broke apart after 1054 under the pressure of attacks by nomads from the steppes, fragmenting Russia into a number of independent principalities. The devastating attack by the Mongols in 1237-40 resulted in widepread destruction of cities, loss of life, and wiped out a developing commercial middle class centered around the fur trade. This helped bring about the long rule of autocracy in Russia.[PARAGRAPH:2]Of the various Russian principalities, it was Muscovy that proved to be the most successful. Beginning as the state that collected taxes for Russia's Mongol overlords, the princes of Muscovy eventually gained a position of leadership by throwing off the yoke of their oppressors. Ivan III (1462-1505) consolidated the gains his father, Vasily II, had won in the saddle, and his warrior descendent Ivan IV (1533-84), known as Ivan the Terrible, gained enough power to take the title of "Tsar", or Emperor, in 1547. This "gathering of the Russian lands" became a conscious and irresistible five-century drive by Moscow to annex all Slavic lands, both the Russian territories and the Belorussian and Ukrainian regions. The ascension of Peter I (1694-1725), known as Peter the Great, ushered in and established the social, political, and intellectual trends that were to dominate Russia for the next two centuries. The location of his new capital, St. Petersburg, on the shores of the Gulf of Finland symbolized this shift toward a European involvement. But while the Russian aristocracy may have adopted the courtly behavior and modern military tactics of the West, the vast majority of the Russian people remained mired in a slave-like state of feudal servitude.[PARAGRAPH:2]Catherine the Great (1762-1796), though a German princess who was unrelated to Peter in any way, would prove to be his true intellectual and political heir. Catherine's reign was notable for imperial expansion. Most important were the securing of the northern shore of the Black Sea, the annexation of the Crimea, and the expansion into the steppes beyond the Urals. This permitted the protection of Russian agricultural settlements in the south and the establishment of trade routes through the Black Sea. In the process, the military democracies of the Cossack hosts along the Dnieper, Don, and Volga rivers lost their autonomy and special privileges; the wealthier officers became Russian nobles, receiving the right to own and settle serfs on their own lands, while the fierce horsemen sank to the level of peasants with special military obligations. Catherine's partitioning of Poland also helped bring Russia closer to the rest of Europe, at least geographically.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite the heritage of Peter and Catherine, by the time of Nicholas II (1894-1917) Russia was in disarray, plagued by internal misery and oppression. Defeat in the Russo-Japanese War followed by the 1905 Revolution indicated that Russia was in need of drastic reforms, but the autocratic structure of the Tsarist state was poorly suited to adapt to changing conditions. World War I imposed stresses on the Tsardom that it could not meet, and the Russian Revolution broke out in 1917, riding on a wave of popular discontent. The Kerensky Provisional Government, a moderate attempt to resolve the problems, collapsed in the face of the Bolshevik (Communist) revolution. Given the Bolshevik desire to dominate the whole of Russia and the rest of the former Tsarist empire, civil war was inevitable, and a bitter struggle between Red (Communist) and White (Tsarist) forces lasted until the Bolsheviks were victorious in 1922. Stalin would complete the consolidation of Communist power begun by Lenin, most notably through the forced industrialization of the Five-Year Plans and the mass starvations engendered by the collectivization of agriculture. Despite an almost inhuman level of suffering imposed on the Russian people, Stalin would lead the Soviet Union through the greatest threat to its existence during the Nazi invasion of 1941-45, and help it emerge as one of the world's superpowers following the Second World War.[PARAGRAPH:2]But in the ensuing Cold War, Russia's economy tottered towards collapse. The Communist economic system worked well at producing millions of tons of iron for use in tanks, but was unable to produce simple household goods to improve the daily lives of its people. Mikhail Gorbachev attempted to revive the stagnant Soviet economy through the relaxation of economic and political controls, but the forces of free speech and a free market quickly took hold in a way Gorbachev never would have imagined. Within a few years, the Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe were declaring their independence and new politicians like Boris Yeltsin were demanding democratic elections. An ill-conceived, ill-planned, and poorly executed coup attempt to unseat Yeltsin occurred in August 1991, bringing an end to the Communist Party and accelerating the movement to disband the Soviet Union. Yeltsin dissolved the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in December 1991, banned the Communist Party in Russia, and seized all of its property, becoming the first president of Russia. Today, as it often has throughout its history, Russia finds itself struggling between whether to follow the example of the West or pursue its own unique path of development.</English>

		<Chinese>自公元前2000年以来，印欧人、乌拉尔-阿尔泰人以及其他许多民族都曾经占据这片今天被称为俄罗斯的土地，但对于他们的制度和活动我们知之甚少。现代俄罗斯的起源可以追溯到公元770年，当时维京探险者开始向整个伏尔加河流域渗透。也许是为了寻找新的通往东方的贸易路线，这些斯堪的纳维亚人从建立在波罗的海东岸各河口的基地进入芬兰人和斯拉夫人部落聚居的地区，并在那里发现了取之不尽的自然资源。[PARAGRAPH:2]数十年间，这些罗斯人——也就是当初的维京殖民者——和其他在更西边活动的斯堪的纳维亚人一道，将他们劫掠活动的范围沿着通往巴格达和君士坦丁堡的水路不断扩展，终于在公元860年抵达黑海岸边。在930年至1000年间，整个这一地区完全被基辅的罗斯人所控制。缓慢成长的基辅公国的命脉主要是倚赖这些维京领主所组织的商业活动。大约在公元1000年的时候，由于拜占庭传教士的影响，基辅的王公们皈依了基督教，由此中世纪的俄罗斯诸国与拜占庭维持了紧密的文化联系。公元1054年后，统一的基辅罗斯国家在来自大草原的游牧部落进攻的压力下逐渐分崩离析，形成诸多独立的公国。1237-1240年间，毁灭性的蒙古入侵导致大范围的城市毁灭和人口损失，并沉重打击了随皮毛贸易而发展的商业中产阶级。这些都有助于在俄国长期独裁统治的形成。[PARAGRAPH:2]在众多俄罗斯公国中，莫斯科被证明是最成功的一个。起初，莫斯科的大公们只是替俄罗斯的蒙古统治者征收税款而已。但随后他们在对抗蒙古人的过程中逐渐取得领导地位。伊凡三世（1462-1505在位）巩固了他父亲瓦西里二世在马背上获得的权势。而他武勇的继承人伊凡四世（1533-1584在位，即伊凡雷帝）更是在1547年开始自称“沙皇”。“统治全俄罗斯”成为历代莫斯科统治者的头号信条，并推动了其后长达五个世纪之久的对所有斯拉夫领地的扩张行动，包括俄罗斯、白俄罗斯和乌克兰。彼得一世（1694-1725在位，即彼得大帝）引进并建立了一整套社会、政治和文化制度，在俄罗斯其后两百年的历史中占据着主导地位。他那位于芬兰湾沿岸的首都圣彼得堡，象征着俄罗斯开始融入西方的重大转变。但是虽然俄罗斯的贵族已经接受西方的文化礼仪和军事制度，广大的俄国人民却仍然深陷于封建义务的桎梏之中，犹如奴隶一般。[PARAGRAPH:2]叶卡捷琳娜大帝（1762-1796在位）本是一位日尔曼公主，与彼得一世没有任何关系，但却被认为是他的智慧和政策的真正继承人。她统治期间最引人注目的是帝国的扩张。其中最重要的是确保了黑海北岸领土，吞并克里米亚汗国并越过乌拉尔山进入西伯利亚大草原。这些行动保护了俄罗斯南部的农业聚落和穿过黑海的商路的畅通。在这个过程中，居住在第聂伯河、顿河与伏尔加河沿岸，尚处于军事民主社会的哥萨克人逐渐丧失了他们的自治地位和特权，富有的军官成为俄罗斯贵族，他们有权利在其土地上蓄养农奴，而好斗的骑手则被降级成有特殊兵役义务的农民，由哥萨克人所组成的哥萨克骑兵部队经常被作为沙皇俄国对外征战的主力。这一时期对波兰的瓜分也使得俄国更加接近欧洲的其他部分，至少在地理上如此。[PARAGRAPH:2]尽管有彼得和叶卡捷琳娜遗留下来的丰功伟业，到尼古拉二世在位期间（1894-1917），连年的对外战争及内乱与经济萧条使得俄罗斯已是一片混乱。日俄战争的失败以及接踵而来的1905年革命表明俄国需要一次激烈的改革，但是沙皇专制政权未能调整以适应改变了的情势。第一次世界大战对这个沙皇国家产生了意想不到的影响，大众的不满导致了1917年俄国革命的爆发。克伦斯基临时政府试图缓解这些问题，但最终还是在布尔什维克革命中崩溃了。由于布尔什维克党想要控制整个俄罗斯以及沙皇俄国的其余部分，内战于是不可避免。红军（共产主义者）和白军（保皇党人）之间的艰苦战斗一直持续到1922年布尔什维克取得胜利。斯大林进一步巩固了列宁所开创的共产党政权，其中最引人注目的是因实施五年计划、强制推行工业化和农业集体化所造成的大范围饥荒。尽管俄国人民遭受了巨大的痛苦和损失，斯大林最终带领苏联挺过了对其存在最大的威胁——1941-1945年的纳粹德国入侵，并使其成为第二次世界大战之后世界上的两大超级强国之一。[PARAGRAPH:2]不过在冷战的过程中，俄罗斯的经济一步步走向崩溃。共产主义经济系统在生产成千上万吨用于坦克的钢材时运转良好，却不能生产简单的日用品以改善群众生活。米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫试图通过放松经济和政治控制以激活停滞的苏联经济。但言论自由和自由市场的力量迅速转向他所不曾料想到的方向。几年内，苏联在东欧的卫星国纷纷宣布自主，而新的政治家诸如鲍里斯·叶利钦开始呼吁进行民主选举。1991年8月一场企图推翻叶利钦的失败政变宣告了共产党统治的终结，并加速了苏联的瓦解。1991年12月，叶利钦宣布解散苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟，在俄罗斯取缔共产党，查封其所有的资产，随后他成为俄罗斯的第一任总统。今天，如其过往历史中一样，俄罗斯人仍然对到底是跟随西方的模式还是坚持自己的独特发展道路争论不休。</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]The Parthenon was constructed in 433 BC, in Athens, Greece, in honor of Athens' patron goddess, Athena. Measuring 100 feet by 225 feet, the Parthenon is constructed almost totally of marble. The exterior of the Parthenon is ringed with Doric-style columns more than 30 feet in height, and the center part of the temple, called the "cella," is a large open space which once held a statue of Athena. Much of the temple was decorated with beautiful marble statues and friezes celebrating Athena and the glories of Athens.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Parthenon has suffered much from the ravages of time. In the 5th century a Roman Emperor stole the statue of Athena and moved it to Constantinople, where it was subsequently destroyed. In the 13th century the Parthenon was converted to a Catholic church, which involved altering the internal structure and removing (and probably destroying) many statues dedicated to the old gods. In the 15th century Athens was captured by the Ottomans, and the temple was turned into a mosque. In the 17th century the Parthenon was partially destroyed during a war between the Ottomans and Venetians. Finally, in the 19th century, the British ambassador to Greece looted all of the surviving marble friezes from the building, which he subsequently sold to the British museum.[PARAGRAPH:1]Despite the centuries of neglect, mutilation and pillaging, the Parthenon still stands - a remarkably powerful and beautiful symbol of the glories of ancient Greece.</English>

		<English>[TAB]A collection of imperial structures in Beijing, the Forbidden Palace stands as a testament to the Chinese architectural ingenuity and aesthetic. Ornamental gardens, terraces and fountains surround the magnificent structure, which became the capital of China in 1421. It was the residence of 24 emperors of the Ming and Qing Dynasties until the last emperor abdicated in 1911. Although the correct title for the building is the Imperial Palace, it is more widely known as the "Forbidden" Palace because ordinary people were barred from entering its grounds. With a 160-foot moat and walls 30 feet tall, there was little chance that they would get inside unwanted. The Forbidden Palace is enormous; it occupies 170 acres and contains 8,706 rooms. An estimated eight to ten thousand people lived inside the palace to serve the needs of the emperor. Today, the Forbidden Palace is a major tourist attraction, and it is still used as a symbol of Chinese sovereignty.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The ballista (Latin, from Greek ballistra and that from ballo, "throw"), plural ballistae, was an ancient missile weapon which launched a large projectile at a distant target.[PARAGRAPH:1]Developed from earlier Greek weapons, it relied upon different mechanics, using two levers with torsion springs instead of a prod, the springs consisting of several loops of twisted skeins. Early versions ejected heavy darts or spherical stone projectiles of various sizes for siege warfare. It developed into a smaller sniper weapon, the Scorpio, and possibly the polybolos.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the absorption of the Ancient Greek city-states into the Roman Republic in 146 BC, the highly advanced Greek technology began to spread across many areas of Roman influence. This included the hugely advantageous military advances the Greeks had made (most notably by Dionysus of Syracuse), as well as all the scientific, mathematical, political and artistic developments.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Romans 'inherited' the torsion powered Ballista, which had by now spread to several cities around the Mediterranean, all of which became Roman spoils of war in time, including one from Pergamum, which was depicted among a pile of 'trophy' weapons in relief on a balustrade.[PARAGRAPH:1]The torsion ballista, developed by Alexander, was a far more complicated weapon than its predecessor and the Romans developed it even further, especially into much smaller versions, that could easily be carried.</English>

		<English>[H1]Espionage[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Espionage Points[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Using the Espionage Slider, players may assign a percentage of their trade income towards the production of Espionage Points. On the Espionage Screen, these points may be assigned to leaders that the player has met. These points may be used to perform various Active and Passive Espionage Missions. Active Missions require the player to spend Espionage Points and have a spy in the territory of the opponent they wish to perform the mission against. Passive Missions will take effect as the player accrues more points against a specific opponent. Having more espionage points accumulated will increase the cost of your opponents' missions towards you and reduce the cost of your missions towards them.[PARAGRAPH:1]The [LINK=BUILDING_COURTHOUSE]Courthouse[\LINK], [LINK=BUILDING_JAIL]Jail[\LINK], [LINK=BUILDING_PALACE]Palace[\LINK], [LINK=BUILDING_CASTLE]Castle[\LINK], [LINK=BUILDING_SECURITY_BUREAU]Security Bureau[\LINK] and [LINK=BUILDING_INTELLIGENCE_AGENCY]Intelligence Agency[\LINK] all increase the production of Espionage points. The [LINK=CIVIC_NATIONHOOD]Nationhood[\LINK] Civic also provides an Espionage bonus and the Security Bureau Building increases the point cost of enemy missions in your cities.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Espionage Screen[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Espionage Points may be assigned to specific opponents on the Espionage Screen. If you do not assign points to specific leaders, they will be evenly divided between all known civs. By increasing the "Weight" item next to each opponent's portrait, you can assign the portion you would like each opponent to receive. Increasing the weight next to an opponent's name to "1" will assign all Espionage Points to that opponent. Increasing one opponent's weight to "2" while keeping two other opponents' weight at "1" and another's at "0" will give the first opponent twice as many points as the second and third, while the fourth will receive none. You may assign Weights in any fractions you like, up to 99. In this way, you can finely tune the portion of Espionage Points you would like assigned to each of your opponents.[PARAGRAPH:1]Below "Weight" is a number that shows the cost modifier for your Espionage Missions against this opponent. This number is based on the total number of Espionage Points you have spent throughout the game against this opponent. If the number is below 100%% that means you have spent more on Espionage than your opponent, and your missions may be performed at a discount. If the number is greater than 100%%, it means your opponent has spent more on Espionage than you. This will increase the cost of your Espionage Missions directed towards that opponent. The bottom item on the list states exactly how many Espionage Points you earn per turn towards that opponent. You can also see the Espionage Points you have against all players and the points they have against you by hovering the mouse over their score in the main interface.[PARAGRAPH:1]On the right half of the espionage screen is the list of all the Espionage Missions and their costs. You may click on an opponent's portrait to see a list of all their visible cities and the cost of missions in the selected city. Costs vary according to a number of factors, including the size of the city, its distance from your civilization, and religions present. If the cost of a Mission is blank, this means that the Mission requires more information to determine the exact cost, meaning you must move a spy into enemy territory before the mission cost can be determined. [PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Spies[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Spies may be built by a Civilization that has researched [LINK=TECH_ALPHABET]The Alphabet[\LINK]. Spies differ greatly from most units. Completely invisible to enemy Civilizations, Spies can enter enemy territory to perform one Espionage Mission per turn. Active missions are tile sensitive, meaning you will have to sneak your Spy onto the enemy improvement or city you wish to affect. Performing a mission costs a certain number of Espionage Points and will cause an indicator to pop-up for your opponent over the location of the mission, informing him of the act (but not necessarily of your Spy). If the mission succeeds, the Spy may  survive to perform more Missions, or she may be caught and destroyed. If the mission fails, the Spy will be destroyed, but no Espionage Points will be consumed. The cost of these Espionage Missions decrease the longer a Spy remains stationary on a tile, but every turn a Spy remains in enemy territory, there is a chance that she will be caught and destroyed. The chances of being caught increase with your opponent's Espionage spending, with the presence of a Security Bureau and if your Spy has recently performed a mission against that tile. If the Spy is caught, there is also a chance that its owner will be revealed.[PARAGRAPH:1]In addition to performing Espionage Missions, Spies also make excellent intelligence gatherers. They can use enemy roads and enter the cities of opponents with whom the player is at war, allowing the player access to otherwise unreachable information. The downside is that spies have a chance to get caught when they end their turn in unwelcome territory, even if they perform no active missions. Unwelcome territory is any territory belonging to a rival with whom you do not have an open borders agreement.[PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Missions[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]To perform an Espionage Mission, a player must move a Spy unit to the plot or city where they would like to perform the mission and select the Espionage Mission button.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Espionage Missions are:[NEWLINE][TAB][BOLD]Sabotage Improvement[\BOLD] - Destroy an enemy improvement or route[NEWLINE][TAB][BOLD]Sabotage Building[\BOLD] - Destroy a building within an enemy city[NEWLINE][TAB][BOLD]Steal Treasury[\BOLD] - Steal a portion of your opponent's treasury, between 10 and 100%%[NEWLINE][TAB][BOLD]Spread Culture[\BOLD] - Increase your cultural influence in a city[NEWLINE][TAB][BOLD]Poison Water[\BOLD] - Temporarily increase the amount of unhealthiness within an enemy city[NEWLINE][TAB][BOLD]Foment Unhappiness[\BOLD] - Temporarily increase unhappiness within an enemy city[NEWLINE][TAB][BOLD]Support City Revolt[\BOLD] - Send a city into revolt for one turn.

Invisible to all other units, Great Spies can explore rival territory, and will give a massive bonus of Espionage Points against a specific civilization if you expend the Spy in their city. They may also join a city as a super specialist, increasing science and espionage output of a city; or they may construct a [LINK=BUILDING_SECRET_SERVICE]Scotland Yard[\LINK] in a city, adding a significant bonus to Espionage production in that city.</English>

It was in many ways more like a modern institute for advanced studies than what we now call a 'museum.'[PARAGRAPH:2]Modern museums, as distinct from display halls for the personal property of elite members of society, are mostly a phenomenon of the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. Public access to the museums was gradually broadened as they evolved from being kept 'collections' and also became facilities for displaying the artifacts and educating the public on their significance. Associated with the rise of archaeology and the investigation of our ancient past, and with the spread of higher levels of literacy among the general public, museums serve to keep and preserve relevant historical artifacts, often placing them on display for the public.[PARAGRAPH:2]Today there are museums of varying size on almost every subject imaginable that relates to our past, including but not limited to art, history, paleontology and ancient life, the sciences, technology, and various crafts.</English>

		<English>[H1]Mustafa Kemal Atat&#252;rk[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]President of Turkey[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1881 - 1938 AD[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1] Mustafa Kemal Atat&#252;rk, until November 24, 1934 Gazi Mustafa Kemal Pasha, Turkish army officer and revolutionary statesman, was the founder and the first President of the Republic of Turkey. Mustafa Kemal established himself as a successful military commander while serving as a division commander in the Battle of Gallipoli. Following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire at the hands of the Allies, and the subsequent plans for its partition, Mustafa Kemal led the Turkish national movement in what would become the Turkish War of Independence. His successful military campaigns led to the liberation of the country and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey. As the Republic's first president, Mustafa Kemal introduced a range of far-reaching reforms which sought to create a modern, democratic and secular state. According to the Law on Family Names, the Turkish National Assembly presented Mustafa Kemal with the surname "Atat&#252;rk" (meaning "Father Turk" or "Ancestor Turk") on November 24, 1934.[PARAGRAPH:2] The history of modern Turkey begins with the foundation of the republic on October 29, 1923 (the Republic was declared on January 20, 1921), with Mustafa Kemal (Atat&#252;rk) as its first president. The government was formed from the Ankara-based revolutionary group, led by Atat&#252;rk. The second constitution was ratified by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey on April 20, 1924. For about the next 10 years, the country saw a steady process of secular Westernization through Atat&#252;rk's Reforms, which included the unification of education; the discontinuation of religious and other titles; the closure of Islamic courts and the replacement of Islamic canon law with a secular civil code modeled after Switzerland's and a penal code modeled after the Italian Penal Code; recognition of the equality between the sexes and the granting of full political rights to women on 5 December 1934; the language reform initiated by the newly founded Turkish Language Association; replacement of the Ottoman Turkish alphabet with the new Turkish alphabet derived from the Latin alphabet; the dress law (the wearing of a fez, a traditional Muslim hat, is outlawed); the law on family names; and many others.[PARAGRAPH:2] Atat&#252;rk sought to modernize and democratise a new Turkish Republic from the remnants of the Ottoman Empire. In his quest to do so, Atat&#252;rk had implemented far-reaching reforms, the consequence of which has led Turkey towards the European Union today. The emphasis placed on secularism and nationalism had also led to a degree of conflict within society. Some practicing Muslims found the idea of secularism as being against the teaching of Islam, and criticise the state for not allowing full freedom of religion. In Turkey to this day Islam is still curbed and women are not allowed to wear their headscarves in public buildings. Ethnic minorities such as Kurds have also sought to gain more cultural rights, which in the past, has been limited by the promotion of Turkish nationalism. Despite these conflicts, Atat&#252;rk continues to be revered throughout Turkey and his principles remain the backbone of modern Turkish politics.[PARAGRAPH:2] His successor, Ismet Inonu, fostered a posthumous Atat&#252;rk personality cult which has survived to this day, even after Atat&#252;rk's own Republican People's Party lost power following democratic elections in 1950. Atat&#252;rk's face and name are seen and heard everywhere in Turkey: his portrait can be seen in all public buildings, in schools, in all kinds of school books, on all Turkish banknotes, and in the homes of many Turkish families. It is common even after so many years, in addition to commemorative ceremonies on November 10, at 09:05 a.m. (the exact time of his death), many vehicles and people will pause for one minute in remembrance all over the country at the same instant.</English>

Vargas led Brazil for 18 years, the longest of any President, and second in Brazilian history only to Emperor Pedro II among heads of state. He favored nationalism, industrialization, centralization, social welfare and populism - for the latter, Vargas won the nickname "The Father of the Poor". He was a proponent of workers' rights as well as a staunch anti-communist.[PARAGRAPH:2]Vargas was brought to power by political outsiders and the rank and file of the Armed Forces in the Revolution of 1930, a reaction to his loss in elections earlier that year. His ascent marked the end of the Brazilian oligarchic Old Republic and states-dominated coffee with milk politics. He successfully influenced the outcome of the Brazilian presidential election of 1934, and instituted an authoritarian corporatist regime in 1937 known as the New State, prolonging his hold on power. Vargas went on to appease and eventually dominate his supporters, and pushed his political agenda as he built a propaganda machine around his figure.[PARAGRAPH:2]Vargas sought to transform Brazil from a plantation-based economy into an industrialized powerhouse under the guidance of the government intervention. His embrace of developmentalism was expressed not only in strong rhetoric, but also by lending protection to domestic industries and in a heavy investment budget aimed at kick-starting "strategic" sectors and setting up the necessary infrastructure. Vargas created state monopolies for oil (Petrobras), mining (Vale), steelmaking (National Siderurgy Company), alkalis (National Alkalis Company) and automobiles (National Motors Factory). His policies shaped the Brazilian economic debate for decades, from the governments of Juscelino Kubitschek and leftist Jo锟給 Goulart to the right-wing military dictatorship of 1964 to 1985. The protectionist trend was reversed by the 1990s with the liberal reforms of Fernando Collor de Mello and Fernando Henrique Cardoso.[PARAGRAPH:2]With the global rise of democracy in the aftermath of World War II, Vargas agreed to cede power in free elections, thus ending the Vargas Era. His popularity earned him a late presidential term, but mounting pressure and political strife over his methods led him to suicide. He was the first president in the country to draw widespread support from the masses and is regarded as the most influential Brazilian politician of the twentieth century. He had also been a lawyer and landowner who occupied the 37th chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters from 1943 until his death in 1954.</English>

This allows the plane to have a large total wing area, while keeping the individual wings short and reducing the structural load on each wing. For early aircraft this was helpful, because it reduced the stress on their wooden construction, while allowing them to fly at very low speeds because of the large wing area.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Wright Brothers' first aircraft was a biplane, as were many of the other prototype flying machines of that era. Many of the aircraft of the first two decades of aviation were biplanes (or triplanes), including the military aircraft of World War I, with only a limited number of exceptions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The main drawbacks of biplane construction are poor aerodynamics and excess weight, especially because of the mass of struts and stays required to hold the wings together. As more powerful engines made greater speeds possible, and as the advent of metal aircraft hulls in the 1930s made it easier to rely on the strength of a single pair of wings, the biplane became comparatively obsolete.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Gondeshapur was the intellectual center of the Sassanid empire and the home of the Academy of Gondeshapur. Founded in 271 CE by the Sassanid king Shapur I, Gondeshapur was home to the world's oldest known teaching hospital, and also comprised a library and a university. It was located in the present-day province of Khuzestan, in the southwest of Iran, not far from the Karun river. The Manichean prophet Mani's imprisonment and death are also said to have taken place in Gondeshapur.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gondeshapur was one of the major cities in Khuzestan province of the Persian empire. The name Gondeshapur (Pahlavi Gund-i Shapur) comes from the compound term Gund-Dez-i Shapur "Citadel of Shapur". Most scholars believe Shapur I, son of Ardeshir (Artaxexes), to have founded the city after defeating a Roman army led by Emperor Valerian.  Shapur II made Gondeshapur his capital. However, a few scholars believe that there may have been a city at this location under the Parthian dynasty of what is now Iran proper and Khvarvaran province what is today known as Iraq. [PARAGRAPH:2]In 489 CE, the Nestorian established scientific center in Edessa, was transferred to Vansibin, also known as "Nisibin, then under Persian rule with its secular faculties at Gondeshapur, Khuzestan. Here, scholars, together with Pagan philosophers banished by Justinian from Athens carried out important r esearch in Medicine, Astronomy, and Mathematics". (Hill, p.4)  However, it was under the rule of the Sassanid monarch Khusraw (531-579 CE), called Anushiravan "The Blessed" and known to the Greeks and Romans as Chosroes, that Gondeshapur became known for medicine and erudition. Khusraw I gave refuge to various Greek philosophers, Syriac-speaking Christians and Nestorians fleeing religious persecution by the Byzantine empire. The Sassanids had long battled the Romans and Byzantines for control of present day Iraq and Syria and were naturally disposed to welcome the refugees.  It offered training in medicine, philosophy, theology and science. The faculty were versed not only in the Zoroastrian and Persian traditions, but in Greek and Indian learning as well. According to The Cambridge History of Iran, it was the most important medical center of the ancient world (defined as Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Near East) during the 6th and 7th centuries. Anushiravan also turned towards the east, and sent the famous physician Borzouye to invite Indian and Chinese scholars to Gondeshapur. These visitors translated Indian texts on astronomy, astrology, mathematics and medicine and Chinese texts on herbal medicine and religion. Borzouye is said to have himself translated the Pa&#241;catantra from Sanskrit into Persian as Kelile v&#230; Demne.[PARAGRAPH:2]According to Cyril Elgood in A Medical History of Persia, "to a very large extent, the credit for the whole hospital system must be given to Persia". In addition to systemizing medical treatment and knowledge, the scholars of the academy also transformed medical education; rather than apprenticing with just one physician, medical students were required to work in the hospital under the supervision of the whole medical faculty. There is even evidence that graduates had to pass exams in order to practice as accredited Gondeshapur physicians (as recorded in an Arabic text, the Tarikhu l-Hikama). George Ghevarghese Joseph, in his Crest of the Peacock claims that Gondeshapur also had a pivotal role in the history of mathematics.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Sassanid dynasty fell to Muslim Arab armies in 638 CE. The academy survived the change of rulers and persisted for several centuries as a Muslim institute of higher learning. It was later rivaled by an institute established at the Abbasid capital of Baghdad. In 832 CE, Caliph al-Ma'mun founded the famous Baytu l-Hikma, the House of Wisdom. There the methods of Gondeshapur were emulated; indeed, the House of Wisdom was staffed with graduates of the older Academy of Gondeshapur. It is believed that the House of Wisdom was disbanded under Al-Mutawakkil, Al-Ma'mun's successor. However, by that time the intellectual center of the Abbasid Caliphate had definitively shifted to Baghdad, as henceforth there are few references in contemporary literature to universities or hospitals at Gondeshapur. The significance of the center gradually declined. According to LeStrange's 1905 compendium of Arab geographers, The Lands of the Eastern Caliphate, the 10th century writer Muqaddasi described Gondeshapur as falling into ruins.</English>

		<Chinese>冈德沙普是萨珊帝国的知识中心，也是冈德沙普学院的所在地。冈德沙普尔于公元271年由萨珊王朝国王沙普尔一世创建，是世界上最古老的教学医院所在地，还包括一座图书馆和一所大学。它位于今天的胡兹坦省，伊朗西南部，离卡伦河不远。Manichean prophet Mani的监禁和死亡据说也发生在贡德萨布尔。[段落：2 ] Gondeshapur是波斯帝国Khuzestan省的主要城市之一。冈德沙普尔（Pahlavi Gund-i Shapur）这个名字来源于复合词Gund-Dez-i Shapur“Shapur的城堡”。多数学者认为，阿达克塞克斯（Artaxexes）之子沙普尔一世在击败瓦勒良皇帝领导的罗马军队后建立了这座城市。沙普尔二世把冈德沙普作为他的首都。然而，一些学者认为，在帕提亚王朝统治下的这个地方可能有一座城市，即现在的伊朗本土和今天被称为伊拉克的Khvarvaran省。〔2〕公元489年，尼斯顿人在Edessa建立了科学中心，被转移到凡斯宾，也称为“Nisibin”，然后在波斯统治下，在Khuzestan的Gondeshapur有世俗的官能。在这里，学者们与被查士丁尼从雅典驱逐的异教徒哲学家一起，在医学、天文学和数学方面进行了重要的研究。（希尔，第4页）然而，正是在萨珊王朝统治者库斯劳（公元前531-579年）的统治下，被称为阿努什拉文“有福的”，被希腊人和罗马人称为Chosroes，冈德沙普以医学和博学而闻名。库斯劳一世为逃避拜占庭帝国宗教迫害的希腊哲学家、讲叙利亚语的基督徒和内斯托里安人提供避难所。萨珊王朝长期以来一直与罗马人和拜占庭人争夺对当今伊拉克和叙利亚的控制权，自然倾向于欢迎难民。它提供医学、哲学、神学和科学方面的培训。教师们不仅精通琐罗亚斯德教和波斯传统，还精通希腊和印度的学习。根据伊朗剑桥史，它是6、7世纪古代世界（定义为欧洲、地中海和近东）最重要的医疗中心。阿努什拉文也转向东方，并派著名的医生猎狼来邀请印度和中国学者到冈底沙。这些游客翻译了印度的天文、占星术、数学和医学文献以及中国的草药和宗教文献。据说博尔佐耶把自己的《梵语》从梵语译成波斯语，如凯利尔·V·德蒙（Cyril Elgood：波斯医学史上的第2段），“在很大程度上，必须把整个医院制度的功劳归于波斯”。除了医疗和知识的系统化，学院的学者们还对医学教育进行了改革，要求医学生在全院教师的监督下在医院工作，而不是仅仅依靠一名医生。甚至有证据表明，毕业生必须通过考试才能成为经认可的冈德沙普医生（如阿拉伯文本Tarikhu l-Hikama所记录）。George Ghevarghese Joseph在《孔雀的顶峰》中声称冈德斯帕尔在数学史上也有举足轻重的作用。[段落：2 ]撒旦王朝在公元前638年落入穆斯林阿拉伯军队。学院在统治者更迭中幸存下来，并作为穆斯林高等学府持续了几个世纪。后来，在阿巴斯首都巴格达建立的一个研究所与之抗衡。公元832年，哈里发al-Ma'mun建立了著名的Baytu l-Hikma，智慧之家。在那里，人们效仿了冈德沙普的方法；事实上，智慧之家的工作人员都是冈德沙普老学院的毕业生。据信，智慧之家是在Al-Ma'mun的继任者Al-Mutawakkil的领导下解散的。然而，那时阿巴斯哈里发的知识中心已经明确地转移到巴格达，因为从现在起，在当代文献中很少提到冈德沙普的大学或医院。中心的重要性逐渐下降。根据莱斯特兰1905年出版的《阿拉伯地理学家简编》（The Lands of The Eastern Caliphate），10世纪的作家穆卡达西（Muqaddasi）将冈德沙普描述为一片废墟。</Chinese>

Following the revolution, Khomeini became the country's Supreme Leader, a position created in the constitution as the highest ranking political and religious authority of the nation, which he held until his death.[PARAGRAPH:2]Khomeini was a marja ("source of emulation") in Twelver Shi'a Islam, author of more than forty books, but is primarily known for his political activities. He spent more than 15 years in exile for his opposition to the last Shah. In his writings and preachings he expanded the Shi'a Usuli theory of velayat-e faqih, the "guardianship of the jurisconsult (clerical authority)" to include theocratic political rule by the Islamic jurists. This principle (though not known to the wider public before the revolution) was installed in the new Iranian constitution after being put to a referendum.[PARAGRAPH:2]He was named Man of the Year in 1979 by American newsmagazine TIME for his international influence and has been described as the "virtual face of Islam in Western popular culture." He was known for his support of the hostage takers during the Iran hostage crisis and his fatwa calling for the death of British Indian novelist Salman Rushdie.[PARAGRAPH:2]Khomeini has been criticized for these acts and for human rights violations of Iranians (including his ordering of execution of thousands of political prisoners), but also lauded as a "charismatic leader of immense popularity", and a "champion of Islamic revival" by Shia scholars.[PARAGRAPH:2]Khomeini held the title of Grand Ayatollah and is officially known as Imam Khomeini inside Iran and by his supporters internationally, and generally referred to as Ayatollah Khomeini by others.</English>

Most adherents can be found in the Middle East, Asia and Africa, but Islam has a strong presence in Europe as well. Muslims - followers of Islam - believe that there is only one God ("Allah" in Arabic), and that over the years he has revealed his desires to a number of great prophets: Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad. The last and greatest of prophets, Muhammad has written down God's direct words in the Koran, which is the only true guide to a holy life.[PARAGRAPH:2]Muhammad was born in the city of Mecca (which is now part of Saudi Arabia). He lived from 570 to 632. He began life as a merchant, but during his 40th year he experienced a series of visions from God, who commanded him to memorize the verses that would later make up the Koran. Muhammad revealed his visions to others and he gained followers. He and his followers were reviled and attacked by those who did not believe, but they were following the path that God had set for them and emerged triumphant, eventually unifying all of Arabia under one rule. After Muhammad's death, his words spread throughout the Middle East and far beyond.[PARAGRAPH:2]Since Muhammad, Islam has broken into a number of branches, the three most prominent being the Sunni, Shi'ite and Kharijite.

		<English>[H1]Isabella I[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Queen of Castile and Le&#243;n[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1451 - 1504 AD[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Isabella was the daughter of King John II of Castile. At the time of her birth, Spain was divided into a number of smaller kingdoms, with Castile, Portugal and Aragon being three of the largest. The southern part of the country was under Arab rule, the "Moors" having conquered much of Spain in the 8th Century. For Christian Spain, there were two major objectives: unite the country and drive out the Moors. Isabella accomplished both.[PARAGRAPH:2]After her father's death, Castile was ruled by Isabella's older brother, King Henry IV. At eighteen, and against her brother's express wishes, Isabella married Prince Ferdinand, heir to the throne of Aragon. Henry was furious at her - he had wanted her to marry the King of Portugal - but eventually he forgave her and made Isabella his heir. Upon his death in 1474, Isabella became Queen of Castile, and, after a brief war, made an alliance with Portugal, thus uniting much of Spain.[PARAGRAPH:2]Isabella and Ferdinand worked surprisingly well together. They co-ruled their two kingdoms equally (according to many historians, Isabella was the better ruler of the two).[PARAGRAPH:2]Once they were enthroned, the couple set about weakening the Spanish nobility, which Isabella believed had become overly powerful. They created a special military force known as the "Holy Brotherhood" for the express purpose of protecting people and property from attacks by the nobility. They also redistributed some of the nobles' lands and destroyed several of their castles. In other internal matters, Isabella and Ferdinand reorganized the courts and the justice system, and they more closely regulated the country's coinage.[PARAGRAPH:2]Some of Isabella and Ferdinand's other programs were less appealing. The two rulers were Catholic zealots and they had a rabid hatred for non-Catholics, and especially for Jews. In 1478 they petitioned the Pope to establish the Spanish Inquisition. Under Chief Inquisitor Torquemada, the Inquisition tortured and murdered thousands across Spain, driving the heretics out of the country or underground, or forcing them to convert to Catholicism.[PARAGRAPH:2]Interestingly, when they conquered Granada, the last Muslim stronghold in Spain, Isabella and Ferdinand treated those Muslims quite well, allowing them to freely practice their religion in Spain. The Jews of Granada, however, were treated as barbarously as their cousins in other parts of Spain.[PARAGRAPH:2]Perhaps Isabella's most famous act as monarch was her decision to fund Columbus's voyages of exploration. Christopher Columbus was an Italian navigator who was looking for a western route to India; after getting Isabella's backing, he set out to cross the Atlantic to find Asia. Instead, Columbus discovered America.[PARAGRAPH:2]As a ruler, her record is mixed. She did unite her country along with the help of her husband, Ferdinand. She did drive out foreign powers who had occupied Spain for 700 years. She did bring peace and stability to Spain. She did fund exploration which would bring vast new territory and vast wealth to her kingdom. On the other hand, she did launch a terrible campaign of torture and murder against the most vulnerable population in her lands. To her Christian subjects, then, Isabella probably was the best thing that had ever come their way. However her Jewish subjects probably had a somewhat less positive opinion of Her Majesty.  Isabella died in 1504, leaving the kingdom to her daughter.</English>

He is most famously known for his Code of Laws, set in stone and mounted in the middle of ancient Babylon for all to see. Although not the first Babylonian emperor to implement a structured system of laws, Hammurabi was the first to coherently organize and standardize them.[PARAGRAPH:2]Punishments for breaking these laws were varied. Smaller crimes and business infractions were typically dealt with via fines. Crimes dealing with theft or crimes of a more physical nature (assault, battery, murder) typically had harsher penalties involving death, slavery, or banishment. If proven guilty of a crime, the defendant could expect to receive a punishment nearly equivalent to the crime itself. This is quite possibly where the ancient idea of an Eye for an Eye, and the modern variation of A Tit for a Tat, came from.[PARAGRAPH:2]But decisions were not draconian, and took into account circumstance. If a man was to kill another while defending himself, he might only be fined a small fee depending on the social stature of the deceased, instead of facing a sentence of death himself.[PARAGRAPH:2]With a recorded set of responsibilities and consequences for any given action, punishment was no longer left up to the whim of those in power, and people could conduct their business with the assurance that they would not inadvertently commit a serious crime to which the punishment was unknown. This gave the Babylonian empire the much needed stability it required to flourish.[PARAGRAPH:2]Hammurabi further covered his land with strongholds, police garrisons and civilian administrators. His intent was to enforce his laws so that a citizen in his empire could travel from Babylon to the coast of the Mediterranean without fear of harassment or unfair persecution. Safety, stability, and prosperity were to be Hammurabi's gift to his people. </English>

It is located about 45 kilometres (28 miles) northwest of the Spanish capital, Madrid, in the town of San Lorenzo de El Escorial. El Escorial comprises two architectural complexes of great historical and cultural significance: El Real Monasterio de El Escorial itself and La Granjilla de La Fresneda, a royal hunting lodge and monastic retreat about five kilometres away. These sites have a dual nature; that is to say, during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, they were places in which the temporal power of the Spanish monarchy and the ecclesiastical predominance of the Roman Catholic religion in Spain found a common architectural manifestation. El Escorial was, at once, a monastery and a Spanish royal palace. Originally a property of the Hieronymite monks, it is now an monastery of the Order of Saint Augustine.[PARAGRAPH:2]Philip II of Spain, reacting to the Protestant Reformation sweeping through Europe during the sixteenth century, devoted much of his lengthy reign (1556-1598) and much of his seemingly inexhaustible supply of New World gold to stemming the Protestant tide. His protracted efforts were, in the long run, partly successful. However, the same counter-reformational impulse had a much more benign expression, thirty years earlier, in Philip's decision to build the complex at El Escorial.[PARAGRAPH:2]Philip engaged the Spanish architect, Juan Bautista de Toledo, to be his collaborator in the design of El Escorial. Juan Bautista had spent the greater part of his career in Rome, where he had worked on the basilica of St. Peter's, and in Naples, where he had served the king's viceroy, whose recommendation brought him to the king's attention. Philip appointed him architect-royal in 1559, and together they designed El Escorial as a monument to Spain's role as a center of the Christian world.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Little is known of Swedish history before the Viking period of the late 8th century. Two related peoples, the Svear and the G&#246;tar, then lived in south central Sweden. Almost incessantly at war with each other, they united in the 9th century under the control of Svear. The Swedish name for Sweden, Sverige, means "realm of the Svear." Swedish Vikings sailed eastward across the Baltic Sea and into the rivers of Russia. By the 9th and 10th centuries they were doing business as far east as Constantinople. According to legend, a Swedish Viking chieftain, Rurik, was the creator of the first Russian monarchy. Finland came under Swedish rule in the 12th century. In 1397 the Union of Kalmar joined the kingdoms of Sweden, Denmark, and Norway under the Danish monarchy. The Swedes opposed Danish command, which ended in 1523, when Gustavus Vasa came to the Swedish throne as King Gustav I.[PARAGRAPH:2]Under Gustav I and his successors, Sweden became a martial power. Two Swedish monarchs were famed as warrior kings. Gustav II, also known as Gustavus Adolphus, won great triumphs in the Thirty Years' War. As an effect of this war, Sweden increased land in northern Germany and became master of the Baltic region. In 1638, Sweden founded a brief colony in America called New Sweden. Continually challenged by its neighbors, Sweden fought a series of wars with Denmark, Russia, Poland, and Saxony during the early 18th century. The Swedish king Charles XII won first impressive victories. But his devastating defeat by the Russian Tsar Peter the Great in 1709 commenced Sweden's decline as a European power.[PARAGRAPH:2]The loss of Finland to Russia in 1809 led to the deposition of King Gustav IV. A new constitution was adopted and a Frenchman, Jean Baptiste Bernadotte, was chosen as the Swedish crown prince. After Napoleon's defeat in 1814, Norway was taken from Denmark and given to Sweden to substitute its loss of Finland. The union of Sweden and Norway lasted until 1905, when Norway peacefully gained its independence. Bernadotte came to the throne in 1818 as King Charles XIV John and was the founder of the present Swedish royal house.[PARAGRAPH:2]The constant years of war impoverished Sweden. A lack of financial prospects caused a large number of Swedes to emigrate from the country. Sweden was never again to go to war, adopting the policy of neutrality and nonalignment that continues today. The growth of Swedish industry in the early 20th century restored its economy. Sweden also developed its social welfare system that guaranteed the needs of existence to every Swedes. Sweden was able to uphold its neutrality in both World War I and II, establishing itself as a haven for refugees escaping the damage of both these wars. Sweden has also sought to promote peace in not only itself, but in all countries. Many of Sweden's troops served in the United Nations peacekeeping forces.</English>

		<English>[H1]Joseph Stalin[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]General secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1878 - 1953 AD[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]His birth name was Joseph Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili, but to the world he will always be known simply as Stalin ("man of steel" in Russian). Stalin was born in 1878 to a poor Georgian family. His father was a cobbler who often beat his wife and young son. At the age of eight, Stalin began his education in the Gori Church School, where instruction was conducted in Russian and he was mocked for his Georgian accent. Stalin graduated first in his class at the age of fourteen and began attending school next at the Tiflis Theological Seminary. Stalin had no interest in becoming a priest, but the seminary was one of the few institutions of higher learning permitted in Georgia by the repressive tsarist government.[PARAGRAPH:2]It was here that Stalin became involved in the revolutionary socialist movement of Russia; in 1899 he was kicked out of the school for his participation in the radical cause. For the next decade Stalin worked in the political underground of the Caucasus region, for which he was arrested and sent to temporary exile in Siberia several times. Over the years Stalin rose through the ranks of the socialist organizations, and in 1912 he gained a position on the central committee of the Bolshevik Party. He later was appointed as an editor of "Pravda," (meaning, "Truth") the main communist newspaper, which was a position with a great deal of influence.[PARAGRAPH:2]Stalin played little role in the events of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. He and the other editors of Pravda initially supported Keresnsky's Provisional Government, and even refused to publish Lenin's articles calling for it to be overthrown. (Later, Stalin would falsely claim that he had been part of a "Party Center" which directed the October Revolution.) During the Russian Civil War, Stalin served as a military commissar on various different fronts, but he seems to have been an indifferent military man at best. It was when that conflict ended that his star began to rise.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1922 Stalin secured the position of General Secretary of the Communist Party, a post that no one else particularly wanted. Stalin recognized the potential power of this job, however, as it gave him control over appointments within the Party. Over time, Stalin built up a group of fiercely loyal followers, eventually becoming one of the most powerful men in the Party.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the death of Lenin in 1924, Stalin formed a centrist ruling coalition along with Kamenev and Zinoviev. In doing so Stalin successfully outmaneuvered his enemy Trotsky, another strong contender for leadership of the USSR. In 1928 Trotsky went into exile and he was assassinated some time thereafter (it is assumed at Stalin's orders). Then Stalin turned on his former allies Kamenev and Zinoviev, driving them from power as well. By the beginning of the 1930s, Stalin had secured undisputed power over both the Communist Party and all of the Soviet Union.[PARAGRAPH:2]With his enemies out of the way, Stalin could begin a thorough transformation of Russia. Up until the First World War Russia had been primarily an agrarian society, but Stalin was determined to change it into an industrial powerhouse. In 1928 he implemented the Five Year Plans, designed to force rapid industrialization upon the country at any cost. To curb the power of the prosperous independent farmers (known as "kulaks") Stalin also nationalized individual farms, replacing them with larger collective farms. Stalin's collectivization of agriculture proved to be a disaster: output actually fell, and there was a great deal of peasant resistance (which was ruthlessly crushed by the Red Army). Despite the crop shortfalls Stalin sold off the agricultural produce of the USSR to get foreign currency to pay for further industrialization, deliberately engineering a mass famine which may have killed as many as 10 million people.[PARAGRAPH:2]Fearing an army plot against him, in 1936 Stalin embarked on the Great Purge, which quickly degenerated into a terrible witch hunt. Many of the old communist leaders were executed after bizarre show trials during which they confessed to outlandish crimes. At the same time the Red Army was gutted of its officer corps. Millions of innocent people died or were exiled to Siberia for no offense whatsoever. Stalin's paranoia claimed an untold number of lives before it had run its course.[PARAGRAPH:2]Stalin's Soviet Union was ruthlessly authoritarian, but it had achieved its goal of industrialization. Advances were made in science, and the free provision of certain state services - including education and housing - did provide new opportunities for many millions of former peasants (although the standard of living remained extremely low compared to Western countries). Freedom of expression was nonexistent, however, and the practice of any kind of religion was made illegal.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the 1930s, Stalin was convinced that Hitler's Nazi Germany was a terrible threat to the Soviet Union. He sought defensive pacts and alliances with England and France, but was soundly rebuffed by both countries. Hoping to stave off what he saw as the USSR's inevitable conflict with Germany until his country had a chance to arm itself, Stalin signed a Faustian bargain with Hitler to divide Eastern Europe between the two powers. In September of 1939 Nazi Germany invaded Poland and three weeks later the Soviet Union jumped into the conflict to claim the eastern half of the country.[PARAGRAPH:2] By doing so Stalin believed that he had earned Hitler's gratitude (if not friendship), and that a German attack on the USSR did not lay in the imminent future. However, like so many other leaders Stalin totally misread Hitler, and despite increasingly frantic warnings of German soldiers massing on the borders, he was totally caught off guard when in June of 1941 Hitler launched a massive invasion. In fact, for the first days of the invasion Stalin remained convinced that it was some kind of mistake and refused to let his troops counterattack for fear of provoking Hitler! Because of Stalin's blunders the Soviets suffered enormous losses in the first few weeks.[PARAGRAPH:2]With Stalin stunned into bewildered inaction by his miscalculations, it was only the sheer size of Russia that prevented the Germans from winning a quick victory. In December of 1941 winter - Russia's oldest and best ally - saved Moscow from capture. Regaining his composure, Stalin then led the Soviet Union in a bitter and gruesome struggle to the death against Nazi Germany, with countless atrocities on both sides. Stalin's transfer of heavy industry east into the Urals, combined with the unbelievable size and manpower of the Soviet Union - supported by heavy British and American fighting in the West - ultimately led to victory in 1945, when Soviet troops marched triumphantly into Berlin. The cost, however, was staggering: an estimated 10 million Russian soldiers and 20 million civilians died in the conflict.[PARAGRAPH:2]By the end of the war the Red Army had overrun Eastern Europe, and once there Stalin had no intention of leaving. Despite promising to allow free elections during wartime conferences with the Americans and British, Stalin had no intention of doing anything of the sort and he set up puppet communist regimes across the region. While Tito's government in Yugoslavia successfully broke away from Stalin's bloc, the rest of the countries in Eastern Europe would spend the next three decades under the oppressive rule of the Soviet Union.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite their uneasy alliance during the recent war, the USSR remained on hostile terms with its erstwhile Western Allies. Stalin's support of the Communist Chinese and his blockade of West Berlin in 1948 helped led to the outbreak of the Cold War, a bitter period of proxy warfare and ever-growing nuclear arsenals that would drag on for fifty bleak years.[PARAGRAPH:2]During his reign Stalin encouraged the development of a sycophantic cult of personality where he was worshipped as little less than a god. When he finally died in 1953 there was an enormous outpouring of genuine grief across the Soviet Union. Later, after Khrushchev revealed the extent of Stalin's crimes in his secret speech of 1956, public opinion would become less favorable. Overall, it must be said that Stalin was successful in changing the backwards agricultural state of the tsars into a modern global superpower. No country deserves more credit for defeating Nazi Germany than the Soviet Union.

		<Chinese>[H1]斯大林[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]苏联共产党总书记[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]生卒年份: [\BOLD]1878-1953[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]背景：[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]原名约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·朱加施维里，但以斯大林的名字闻名于世（斯大林在俄文中是“钢铁一样的人”的意思），斯大林在1878年诞生于一个贫寒的格鲁吉亚家庭。他的父亲是个经常虐待妻儿的鞋匠。在八岁那年，斯大林开始在高里教会学校接受教育。在那里，教学使用俄语，斯大林的格鲁吉亚口音备受嘲弄。斯大林十四岁的时候以头名毕业，紧接着进入了第比利斯神学院。斯大林无意成为牧师，但神学院是在帝俄统治下的少数被允许的格鲁吉亚高等学府。[PARAGRAPH:2]斯大林在这里投身革命。1899年，斯大林因为参加激进运动而被开除。之后的十年斯大林在高加索地区从事地下活动，期间他被逮捕并流放至西伯利亚很多次。斯大林在组织中的地位不断提升，到了1912年他成为了布尔什维克中央委员会的一员。之后他成为了真理报的编辑，这是一个很有影响力的职位。[PARAGRAPH:2]斯大林在1917年十月革命中并没有起多大作用。他和其它编辑最开始支持克伦斯基临时政府，他们甚至拒绝刊载列宁号召推翻临时政府的文章（后来斯大林伪称自己是十月革命的领导核心之一）。在俄国内战期间斯大林作为政委出现在各个前线，但是他的作用无关紧要。从那时起，他时来运转了。[PARAGRAPH:2]1922年，斯大林坐稳了中央委员会书记的位子，这个位子并没有人想争。斯大林看到了这个职位的潜力，他利用这个职位在中央迅速取得权力。他开始培植羽翼，并成为党内最有权势的人。[PARAGRAPH:2]1924年列宁死后，斯大林、卡米涅夫以及奇诺维也夫组成了领导核心。由此斯大林成功排挤他的死敌托洛斯基。1928年托洛斯基遭到流放，并在国外被暗杀。在三十年代初，斯大林整肃了几乎所有的对手，在党内取得空前的权力。[PARAGRAPH:2]肃清了政敌之后，斯大林开始改造他的国家。直到一战的时候俄国仍然处于农业社会，但斯大林决定实行全面工业化。在1928年，斯大林实行了第一个五年计划，不惜一切代价进行工业化。为了削弱自耕农的势力，斯大林国有化了私人农场。斯大林的农业政策被证明是一场灾难：粮食减产引起许多农民的反抗（都被红军无情镇压），尽管农业产量降低，斯大林仍然出售农产品换取外汇以支持工业化。由此引起的饥荒据估计造成了一千万人死亡。[PARAGRAPH:2]1936年斯大林为了粉碎军队内反对他的阴谋而发动“大清洗”，最终形成横扫全国的红色恐怖。许多资深领导人在严刑逼供后承认罪行。大清洗也对军官阶层造大巨大破坏，数以百万计的人被处决或被流放。[PARAGRAPH:2]斯大林在苏联实行冷酷无情的统治，但是他达到了工业化的目标。科学技术获得不断进步，教育和住房成为国家福利，上百万农民成为工人（尽管他们的生活条件跟西方相比仍然十分恶劣）。言论自由不复存在，任何宗教活动都被禁止。[PARAGRAPH:2]自30年代开始，斯大林相信纳粹德国将成为巨大威胁。于是他想跟英法结盟，但遭到冷遇。为了争取时间，斯大林和希特勒达成了瓜分东欧的协议。1939年9月，德国进攻波兰，三个星期后苏联介入战争并吞并波兰东部领土。[PARAGRAPH:2]斯大林相信通过这些举动能换来希特勒的善意而使德国的进攻不会很快发生。然而，跟许多其他领袖一样，斯大林没能读懂希特勒。尽管事先在边界地区收到大量警报，斯大林没有采取防御措施。实际上，在进攻的第一天，斯大林还相信这只不过是误会，而不让他的部队进行反击而触怒希特勒。由于斯大林的失误，苏联红军蒙受了巨大损失。[PARAGRAPH:2]在斯大林被弄懵了的时候，苏联辽阔的版图阻止了德国人赢得速胜。1941年12月，俄国古老的盟友“寒冬”保卫了莫斯科。恢复常态后，斯大林带领苏联人民同纳粹德国展开殊死抗争。斯大林把重工业东移乌拉尔山区，结合苏联巨大的幅员和人力资源，加上西方盟国的支援，苏联红军最终攻陷柏林赢得了战争的胜利。然而，苏联也付出了一千万军人和两千万平民生命的巨大代价。[PARAGRAPH:2]战争结束时，红军已经占据整个了东欧，斯大林也无意撤回他们。尽管在战时斯大林对英美许诺过自由选举，但他无意实行，并在那里广泛地扶植傀儡政权。尽管铁托的南斯拉夫摆脱了苏联的控制，其他的东欧国家却在未来的三十年里饱受苏联的压迫。[PARAGRAPH:2]战时的松散联盟并未缓解苏联对西方的敌意。斯大林对中国共产党的支持以及1948年对西柏林的封锁逐渐引发了冷战。世界在代理人战争与核军备竞赛中度过了五十年。[PARAGRAPH:2]斯大林在统治期间大搞个人崇拜，当他于1953年去世的时候，苏联上下流露出真挚而巨大的悲痛。但到1956年，赫鲁晓夫通过秘密报告披露了斯大林的罪行，公众对他的态度也开始转变。总的来说，斯大林成功地把一个沙皇时代的农业国家变成一个世界级的工业强权。对于战胜德国纳粹，也没有任何其他国家比苏联更有功劳。然而实现这些成就的野蛮做法应该被铭记于心，斯大林也将永远作为一个争议人物名留史册。</Chinese>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_UNIT_CANADIAN_CORVETTE_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]The modern corvette appeared during World War II as an easily built patrol and convoy escort vessel. The British naval designer William Reed drew up a small ship based on the single-shaft Smiths Dock Company whale catcher Southern Pride, whose simple design and mercantile construction standards lent itself to rapid production in large numbers in small yards unused to naval work. First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, later Prime Minister, had a hand in reviving the name "corvette". During the arms buildup leading to World War II, the term "corvette" was almost attached to the Tribal-class destroyer. The Tribals were so much larger than and sufficiently different from other British destroyers that some consideration was given to resurrecting the classification of "corvette" and applying it to them. This idea was dropped, and the term applied to small, mass-produced antisubmarine escorts such as the Flower class of World War II. The first modern corvettes were the Flower class (Royal Navy corvettes were named after flowers, and ships in Royal Canadian Navy service took the name of smaller Canadian cities and towns). Their chief duty was to protect convoys throughout the Battle of the Atlantic and on the routes from the UK to Murmansk carrying supplies to the Soviet Union. The Flower-class corvette was originally designed for offshore patrol work, and was not ideal as an antisubmarine escort; they were really too short for open ocean work, too lightly armed for antiaircraft defense, and little faster than the merchantmen they escorted, a particular problem given the faster German U-boat designs then emerging. They were very seaworthy and manoeuvrable, but living conditions for ocean voyages were appalling. Because of this, the corvette was superseded in the Royal Navy as the escort ship of choice by the frigate, which was larger, faster, better armed, and had two shafts. However, many small yards could not produce vessels of frigate size, so an improved corvette design, the Castle class, was introduced later in the war, with some remaining in service until the mid-1950s.</English>

		<Chinese>[标签]现代护卫舰出现在二战期间，是一种容易建造的巡逻和护航船只。英国海军设计师威廉·里德（William Reed）以单轴史密斯船坞公司（single shaft Smiths Dock Company）的“捕鲸者南方骄傲号”（whale catcher Southern Pride）为基础，绘制了一艘小型船舶，其简单的设计和商业化的建造标准，使其能够在不用于海军工程的小型船坞中大量快速生产。英国海军部的第一任勋爵、后来的首相温斯顿·丘吉尔（Winston Churchill）参与了“corvette”这个名字的复兴。在第二次世界大战前的武器集结期间，“护卫舰”这个词几乎与部落级驱逐舰联系在一起。部落比其他英国驱逐舰要大得多，而且与之有很大的不同，因此人们考虑重新划分“护卫舰”的类别，并将其应用到它们身上。这个想法被放弃了，这个术语被应用于小型的、大规模生产的反潜护航，比如二战的“花”级护航。最早的现代护卫舰是花级护卫舰（皇家海军护卫舰是以花命名的，加拿大皇家海军服役的舰艇是以较小的加拿大城镇命名的）。他们的主要职责是在大西洋战役期间以及从英国到摩尔曼斯克运送补给到苏联的航线上保护车队。花级护卫舰最初是为海上巡逻工作而设计的，作为一个反潜护卫队并不理想；它们实在太短，不能进行公开的海上工作，装备太轻，不能进行防空防御，而且比护卫的商船要快一点，这是一个特殊的问题，因为当时出现了更快的德国U型艇设计。它们非常适合航海和机动，但海洋航行的生活条件令人震惊。因此，护卫舰取代了皇家海军的护卫舰，成为护卫舰的首选，护卫舰更大、更快、装备更好，并且有两个轴。然而，许多小型造船厂无法生产护卫舰大小的船只，因此在战争后期引入了一种改进的护卫舰设计，即城堡级，一些护卫舰一直服役到20世纪50年代中期。</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]Although the origin of the term Khazar and the early history of the Khazar people are obscure, it is fairly certain that the Khazars were originally located in the northern Caucasus region and were part of the western Turkic empire (in Turkistan). The Khazars were in contact with the Persians in the mid-6th century AD, and they aided the Byzantine emperor Heraclius (reigned 610鈥?41) in his campaign against the Persians.[PARAGRAPH:2]By the beginning of the 7th century, the Khazars had become independent of the Turkic empire to the east. But by the middle of that century, the expanding empire of the Arabs had penetrated as far northward as the northern Caucasus, and from then on until the mid-8th century the Khazars engaged in a series of wars with the Arab empire. The Arabs initially forced the Khazars to abandon Derbent (661), but around 685 the Khazars counterattacked, penetrating southward of the Caucasus into present-day Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. The Khazars and Arabs fought each other directly in Armenia in the 720s, and, though victory passed repeatedly from one side to the other, Arab counterattacks eventually compelled the Khazars to permanently withdraw north of the Caucasus. The Khazars' initial victories were important, though, since they had the effect of permanently blocking Arab expansion northward into eastern Europe. Having been compelled to shift the centre of their empire northward, the Khazars after 737 established their capital at Itil (located near the mouth of the Volga River) and accepted the Caucasus Mountains as their southern boundary.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the same period, however, they expanded westward.

The Volga Bulgars and numerous Slavic tribes also recognized the Khazars as their overlords.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although basically Turkic, the Khazar state bore little resemblance to the other Turkic empires of central Eurasia.

The state's military organization also seems to have lacked the forcefulness of those of the greater Turkic-Mongol empires. The Khazars seem to have been more inclined to a sedentary way of life, building towns and fortresses, tilling the soil, and planting gardens and vineyards. Trade and the collection of tribute were major sources of income. But the most striking characteristic of the Khazars was the apparent adoption of Judaism by the khagan and the greater part of the ruling class in about 740. The circumstances of the conversion remain obscure, the depth of their adoption of Judaism difficult to assess; but the fact itself is undisputed and unparalleled in central Eurasian history. A few scholars have even asserted that the Judaized Khazars were the remote ancestors of many eastern European and Russian Jews. Whatever the case may be, religious tolerance was practiced in the Khazar empire, and paganism continued to flourish among the population.[PARAGRAPH:2]The prominence and influence of the Khazar state was reflected in its close relations with the Byzantine emperors: Justinian II (704) and Constantine V (732) each had a Khazar wife. The main source of revenue for the empire stemmed from commerce and particularly from Khazar control of the east-west trade route that linked the Far East with Byzantium and the north-south route linking the Arab empire with northern Slavic lands. Income that was derived from duties on goods passing through Khazar territory, in addition to tribute paid by subordinate tribes, maintained the wealth and the strength of the empire throughout the 9th century. But by the 10th century the empire, faced with the growing might of the Pechenegs to their north and west and of the Russians around Kiev, suffered a decline. When Svyatoslav, the ruler of Kiev, launched a campaign against the Khazars (965), Khazar power was crushed.

Ancient China has long had a tradition of central government, where all decisions were carried out by a central bureaucracy loyal to the Emperor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]In Europe, feudalism meant that the monarch only had limited power over his domains, since it had to be carried out through noble vassals. In the early modern period, European monarchs sought to increase their power by centralising decisions to the royal court. Archetypal for this development was France under Louis XIV, where the nobility was forced to attend the court at Versailles, so the monarch was able to exert control over them. In consequence, the bureaucracy was expanded to implement royal policy across the country. Other European states quickly emulated the success of this French model.</English>

This force was earmarked as a cavalry reserve for use in battle as required. After the decisive victory at the Battle of Ajnadayn in 634 A.D, Khalid, from his army of Iraq, which after Ajnadayn numbered about 8,000 men, organised a force of 4,000 horsemen, which the early historians refer to as The Army of Movement, For want of a better translation, it shall be called the Mobile Guard. This force was kept under his personal command by Khalid. The first recorded use of this mounted force was during the siege of Damascus. The best use of this lightly armed fast moving cavalry revealed at Battle of Yarmouk (636 A.D) in which Khalid ibn Walid, knowing the importance and ability of his cavalry, used them to turn the course of events at every critical instance of the battle with there ability to engage and dis-engage and turn back and attack again from the flank or rear, this resulted in shattering defeat of Byzantine army. This was often used in later years as an advance guard. The main function of this strong mobile striking force was to route the opposing armies with its greater ability of mobility that give it an upper hand for maneuvering against any Byzantine army and cavalry. One of the glorious victory of the mobile guard was at Battle of Hazir in 637 A.D under the command of Khalid, in which not a single Byzantine soldier survived. With this mobile striking force the conquest of Syria was made easy for the Muslims who suffered very low casualties. The mobile guard was instrumentle in the Muslim victory at Battle of Iron bridge which followed by the surrender of Antioch city.[PARAGRAPH:2]Khalid ibn Walid had organized a military staff-a simple beginning of what later in military history would emerge as the General Staff. He had collected from all the regions in which he had fought-Arabia, Iraq, Syria and Palestine a small group of keen and intelligent men who acted as his 'staff officers', mainly functioning as an intelligence staff. They would collect information, organize the despatch and questioning of agents, and keep Khalid up to date with the latest military situation. This was a personal staff rather than the staff of an army headquarters; wherever Khalid went, this staff went with him, and was part of the mobile guard. The Mobile guard remained under the personal command of Khalid ibn Walid for about four years ( 634 - 638 A.D ) until Khalid was dismissed from army by Caliph Umar after the completion of the conquest of Levant. With the dismissal of Khalid this powerful cavalry regiment was dismantled. One of its brilliant commander Qa'qa ibn Amr was already sent to Persian front in 637 A.D along with reinforcement for the Battle of al-Qadisiyyah, he played a heroic role in the battle. A part of it was later sent to Persian front as a reinforcement for the Islamic conquest of Persia. Many of its eminent riders died in the plague during 639 - 640 A.D which approximately killed 25,000 Muslims in Syria, including many of sub-commanders of Mobile guard like Zirrar ibn Azwar, those who servived accompanied the army under the command of Amr ibn al-'As to conquer Egypt. The Mobile Guard was undoubtedly the finest body of men in the Rashidun army-a corps d'elite.</English>

She took the throne at 18, after the death of her uncle, King William IV. At 20 she married Prince Albert, to whom she bore nine children. The couple was very much in love and co-ruled for twenty years. She and Albert were quite interested in science, and in 1851 they inspired the hugely successful Great Exhibition in the Crystal Palace, the proceeds going to establish a number of public museums, including the Albert and Victoria museum; which remains one of the world's finest museums even today.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the early years of her reign Victoria was a quite active monarch, and she won the hearts of her people with her modesty and practicality. It was during this period that she performed her greatest service to the British people: she oversaw the transition of the British throne to a constitutional monarchy.[PARAGRAPH:2]When Albert died in 1861, Victoria was devastated. She went into permanent mourning, retiring from the day-to-day rule of her country and secluding herself on the Isle of Wight, where she was increasingly involved in somewhat dubious spiritual exploration. Her self-pity was legendary - a remarkable change from her youthful modesty and enthusiasm.[PARAGRAPH:2]Victoria's isolation and indifference to the management of her country left room for extremely talented prime ministers, such as Gladstone and Disraeli, to guide Great Britain into a golden age of prosperity and expansion. During this period the Empire came to dominate half of the world's area and population - including India and much of the Orient, as well as large chunks of Africa, Asia, North America and a goodly portion of the Pacific islands.[PARAGRAPH:2]Victoria believed that Great Britain had a mandate from heaven to bring the ignorant peoples of the world beneath the protection of the British flag. She felt that she personally had a duty to these untutored people, to educate and clothe them, and most importantly, to bring them to the church.[PARAGRAPH:2]During her reign, Great Britain grew from a moderate European power into the second greatest empire the world has ever known (exceeded only by the Mongol empire of Genghis Khan), an Empire on which "the sun never set," far overshadowing Imperial Rome in size and might. The Diamond Jubilee, celebrating Victoria's 60th year as monarch, dwarfed in pomp and majesty anything that a puny Caesar could have ever mustered.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Automation is the technology by which a process or procedure is performed with minimal human assistance. Automation or automatic control is the use of various control systems for operating equipment such as machinery, processes in factories, boilers and heat treating ovens, switching on telephone networks, steering and stabilization of ships, aircraft and other applications and vehicles with minimal or reduced human intervention.[PARAGRAPH:2]Automation covers applications ranging from a household thermostat controlling a boiler, to a large industrial control system with ten of thousands of input measurements and output control signals. In control complexity, it can range from simple on-off control to multi-variable high-level algorithms.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the simplest type of an automatic control loop, a controller compares a measured value of a process with a desired set value, and processes the resulting error signal to change some input to the process, in such a way that the process stays at its set point despite disturbances. This closed-loop control is an application of negative feedback to a system. The mathematical basis of control theory was begun in the 18th century and advanced rapidly in the 20th.[PARAGRAPH:2]Automation has been achieved by various means including mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, electronic devices and computers, usually in combination. Complicated systems, such as modern factories, airplanes and ships typically use all these combined techniques. The benefit of automation includes labor savings, savings in electricity costs, savings in material costs, and improvements to quality, accuracy, and precision.[PARAGRAPH:2]The term automation, inspired by the earlier word automatic (coming from automaton), was not widely used before 1947, when Ford established an automation department. It was during this time that industry was rapidly adopting feedback controllers, which were introduced in the 1930s.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Despite political and social upheavals that frequently ravaged the country, China is unique for its longevity and resilience as a politico-cultural entity. Most of China's cultural progress has been accomplished with relatively little outside influence; even when the country was ruled by such "barbarian" peoples as the Chin or Mongols, these were soon absorbed into the fabric of Chinese culture. The casting of bronze and the development of an alphabet date from the period of the Shang dynasty - China's first, believed to have dominated north China from the mid-16th to mid-11th century BC. The overthrow of the Shang dynasty by the Chou (1111-255 BC) spanned three generations; although the vibrant Chou culture produced some of history's greatest philosophers and artists, among them Confucius and Lao-zi, the final two centuries of the dynasty saw China engulfed by a series of civil wars known as the "Warring States" period (403-221 BC).[PARAGRAPH:2]The fighting came to an end when Qin Shi Huang managed to conquer all of his rivals and establish the Ch'in Dynasty (221-206 BC). He became the first Chinese Emperor, and was the first man to unite all of China under a single ruler, but the Ch'in Dynasty was unable to outlive his death. The subsequent Han dynasty was founded by Liu Pang, who also assumed the title of emperor in 202 BC. The four centuries of the Han were ones of considerable changes in imperial, political, cultural, and social development. The Han undertook massive engineering projects (including the Great Wall), and established a Chinese identity that would survive until the advent of Communism. The Cho-ko-nu, a type of repeating crossbow, was developed during the Han period and remained in use by the Chinese for almost two thousand years.[PARAGRAPH:2]By the end of the 2nd century AD the Han Empire had virtually ceased to exist, and was followed by a lengthy period of rival kingdoms that did not end until 618 AD, when the T'ang dynasty came to power. The T'ang were followed by the Sung Dynasty (960-1279 AD), which collapsed in the face of the Mongol invasions. By securing the allegiance of the Hsi Hsia in Tibet (1209), Genghis Khan disposed of a potential enemy and prepared the ground for an invasion of China. For several years Mongol armies pillaged the country; finally, in 1214 Genghis overwhelmed the capital of the northern Chin (modern Beijing). During the next decades there was an uneasy truce between the Mongols in the north and the Sung state in the south. The Mongols resumed their advance in 1250 under Kublai Khan, grandson of Genghis.[PARAGRAPH:2]From 1267 onward, the Mongols, this time assisted by the armored horsemen and auxiliary troops of north China, attacked on several fronts. When organized resistance ceased soon afterward, foreign invaders controlled the whole of China for the only time in history. The Mongols occupied China for a century, but ineptitude on the throne, factionalism at court, and rivalries among generals weakened their rule. Out of this turmoil emerged a new native dynasty, the Ming (1368-1644), known for patronage of the arts. Before turning inward and reverting to an isolationist policy in 1424, the Ming period saw extensive trade with India and Arabia, and Ming navigators may have reached the Americas before Columbus. The Ming were followed by the Manchus (1644-1911), the last imperial dynasty of China, marked by continuous warfare, Western imperialism, rampant corruption, and bureaucratic ineptitude.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the wake of the disastrous Boxer Rebellion, the imperial court could no longer maintain support among the peasantry and army; revolution (1911-1912) followed. The first half of the 20th century saw the disintegration of the old order in China and the foundations of a new society, begun by the short-lived democratic Republic (1912-1920), which quickly degenerated into the dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek. A new revolution, led by the Nationalist Party (KMT) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), erupted. Although they had been united against the Japanese invasion, by the end of World War II civil war raged in China. Nationalists and Communists raced to take over Japanese-held territories, built up their forces, and fought limited engagements while still conducting negotiations; during 1947-1948, after initial Nationalist victories, the strategic balance shifted in favor of the Communists. Four years after Japan's surrender, a profound and popularly based revolution had swept China, and, in October 1949 Mao Zedong proclaimed the People's Republic of China. In 1966, the Communists at the instigation of Mao launched the disastrous "Cultural Revolution," a ten-year assault on "traditional values" and "bourgeois thinking" which ultimately left the country in disarray. After Mao's death in 1976, his rival Deng Xiaopeng assumed power and began social and economic reforms that would see China return to world prominence. China today is one of the world's rising powers, but exactly what course its leaders will chart next remains uncertain.</English>

		<Chinese>虽然经常遭受到政治和社会动乱的冲击，但是中国作为一个政治文化实体的延续性和适应力仍是举世独有的。中国的大多数文化成就都是在极少外来影响的情况下独自完成的。即便在这个国家被“蛮族”统治之时（例如满清和蒙元时期），这些异族也很快就被融入中华文化之中。中国的青铜铸造技术和文字的形成开始于商王朝（据信于公元前16世纪中期至前11世纪中期统治中国北部地区，是国际史学界认可的第一个中国王朝）。商朝被周朝（前1111-前255）历经三代统治者的努力而推翻。虽然周王朝创造了辉煌而活跃的文化，出现了许多世界历史上最伟大的哲学家和艺术家，包括孔子和老子，但后期却陷入诸侯割据纷争不断的局面，即“战国时代”（前403-前221）。[PARAGRAPH:2]诸侯争霸的最终结果是秦王嬴政扫平六国，建立了秦朝（前221-前206）。嬴政首创皇帝尊号，自称“始皇帝”，成为第一位中国皇帝。秦始皇完成了中国本部的首次大一统，但秦朝在他死后不久即土崩瓦解。代之而起的是刘邦建立的汉朝，他于前202年登上帝位。在汉朝统治的四百年间，整个帝国在政治，文化和社会发展等各个方面都发生了显著而深刻的变革，并完成了一系列规模巨大的工程（包括长城的扩建），中华文明的主体民族：汉族也就此形成并传承至今。威力强大的的中国弩也在这一时期发展完善，在汉末还出现了一种设计精巧的连发弩——诸葛弩，弩在中国历朝都是普遍使用的武器。[PARAGRAPH:2]汉帝国在公元二世纪末已不复存在，此后是漫长的分裂和战乱时期，直到618年唐朝的建立。宋朝（960-1279）继唐朝之后兴起，却因蒙古人的入侵而灭亡。成吉思汗于1209年征服西夏，并以此为基地开始对中国的入侵，几年之内即横扫整个中国北部，1214年攻占金朝中都燕京（今北京）。此后数十年间蒙古与宋朝保持南北对峙状态，直到1250年成吉思汗之孙忽必烈再次南下。[PARAGRAPH:2]自1267年起，蒙古人纠集原属金朝的铁甲骑兵和工程部队发动了多路协同进攻，至1279年最终结束了宋朝军队有组织的抵抗，这是有史以来外族入侵者第一次得以控制整个中国。蒙古人对中国的占领持续了一个世纪，逐渐因统治者的无能，宫庭内的争斗和地方军政官员的割据而衰落，最终被一个新的汉族王朝：明朝（1368-1644）所推翻，这个朝代因促进艺术的繁荣而闻名于世。而且明朝在1424年放弃积极外向转取因循守旧政策之前，与印度、阿拉伯地区的海上贸易非常兴旺，有历史学家甚至认为：明朝的航海家先于哥伦布数十年即已到达过美洲。取代明朝的是中国的最后一个王朝：满清（1644-1911）。但满清统治时期却充斥着持续不断的内外战事、西方帝国主义的入侵，以及官僚阶层极度的腐败无能。[PARAGRAPH:2]义和团运动导致的大乱局表明满清朝庭已经彻底失去了广大农民和军队的支持，不久即因辛亥革命（1911-1912）的爆发而被推翻。20世纪上半叶的中国见证了旧秩序的崩溃和新社会形态的逐步形成，先是一个短命的民主共和政府（1912-1920），此后蒋介石逐渐建立起自己的独裁统治。中国国民党和中国共产党人曾在20年代携手推进革命事业，也曾在日本入侵期间团结起来一致对外，但第二次世界大战结束后，双方又分别发展自己的力量并不断因此发生小规模的冲突，同时也在谈判桌上唇枪舌剑，最终导致国共内战的爆发。1947-1948年间，尽管国民党取得了最初的胜利，战局却逐渐向有利于共产党的方向转化。在日本投降之后的第四年，一场广受民众支持，影响深刻久远的革命取得了最后的胜利，1949年10月1日，毛泽东宣布成立中华人民共和国。1966年，共产党人又发动了灾难性的“文化大革命”，这是一场对“传统文化价值”和“资产阶级思想”持续十年的打击，结果却使国民经济面临崩溃的边缘。1976年毛泽东去世后，曾受压制的邓小平重新掌权并实施了一系列的社会与经济改革，中国终于重开民族复兴的进程，再次赢得全世界的瞩目。现在中国的实力正在持续不断地增强，虽然她的未来仍然存在着许多不确定的因素。</Chinese>

At the end of his reign in 1605 the Mughal empire covered most of the northern and central India and was one of the most powerful empires of the age.[PARAGRAPH:2]Akbar, widely considered as one of the greatest and the most influential personalities of the world history, was thirteen years old when he ascended the Imperial Mughal throne in Delhi, following the death of his father Naseeruddin Muahmmad Humayun. During his reign, he eliminated military threats from the powerful Pashtun descendants of Sher Shah Suri, and at the Second Battle of Panipat he defeated the newly self-declared Hindu king Hemu. It took him nearly two more decades to consolidate his power and bring parts of northern and central India into his realm. The emperor solidified his rule by pursuing diplomacy with the powerful Rajput caste, and by admitting Rajput princesses in his harem.[PARAGRAPH:2]Akbar's reign significantly influenced art and culture in the region. Akbar took a great interest in painting, and had the walls of his palaces adorned with murals. Besides encouraging the development of the Mughal school, he also patronised the European style of painting. He was fond of literature, and had several Sanskrit  works translated into Persian, apart from getting many Persian works illustrated by painters from his court. Akbar began a series of religious debates where Muslim scholars would debate religious matters with Sikhs, Hindus, Carvaka atheists, Jews, and Portuguese Roman Catholic Jesuits. He had an intolerant attitude towards Hindus and the other religions during the early years of his reign, but he exercised great tolerance after he began marriage alliances with Rajput princesses. He founded a religious cult, the Din-i-Ilahi (Divine Faith), but it amounted only to a form of personality cult for Akbar, and quickly dissolved after his death.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_NALANDA_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]Nalanda was a Mahavihara, a large and revered Buddhist monastery, in the ancient kingdom of Magadha (modern-day Bihar) in India. The site is located about 95 kilometres (59 mi) southeast of Patna near the city of Bihar Sharif, and was a centre of learning from the fifth century CE to c. 1200 CE. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[PARAGRAPH:2]The highly formalized methods of Jain and Buddhist learning helped inspire the establishment of large teaching institutions such as Taxila, Nalanda, and Vikramashila which are often characterised as India's early universities. Nalanda flourished under the patronage of the Gupta Empire in the 5th and 6th centuries and later under Harsha, the emperor of Kannauj. The liberal cultural traditions inherited from the Gupta age resulted in a period of growth and prosperity until the ninth century. The subsequent centuries were a time of gradual decline, a period during which the tantric developments of Buddhism became most pronounced in eastern India under the Pala Empire.[PARAGRAPH:2]At its peak, the school attracted scholars and students from near and far with some travelling from Tibet, China, Korea, and Central Asia. Archaeological evidence also notes contact with the Shailendra dynasty of Indonesia, one of whose kings built a monastery in the complex.[PARAGRAPH:2]Much of our knowledge of Nalanda comes from the writings of pilgrim monks from Asia such as Xuanzang and Yijing who travelled to the Mahavihara in the 7th century. Vincent Smith remarked that "a detailed history of Nalanda would be a history of Mahayanist Buddhism". Many of the names listed by Xuanzang in his travelogue as products of Nalanda are the names of those who developed the philosophy of Mahayana. All students at Nalanda studied Mahayana as well as the texts of the eighteen (Hinayana) sects of Buddhism. Their curriculum also included other subjects such as the Vedas, logic, Sanskrit grammar, medicine and Samkhya.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nalanda was very likely ransacked and destroyed by an army of the Mamluk Dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate under Bakhtiyar Khalji in c. 1200 CE. While some sources note that the Mahavihara continued to function in a makeshift fashion for a while longer, it was eventually abandoned and forgotten until the 19th century when the site was surveyed and preliminary excavations were conducted by the Archaeological Survey of India. Systematic excavations commenced in 1915 which unearthed eleven monasteries and six brick temples neatly arranged on grounds 12 hectares (30 acres) in area. A trove of sculptures, coins, seals, and inscriptions have also been discovered in the ruins many of which are on display in the Nalanda Archaeological Museum situated nearby. Nalanda is now a notable tourist destination and a part of the Buddhist tourism circuit.[PARAGRAPH:2]On 25 November 2010, the Indian government, through an Act of Parliament, resurrected the ancient university through the Nalanda University Bill, and subsequently Nalanda University was established.

		<English>[TAB]In geography, an oasis is an isolated area of vegetation in a desert, typically surrounding a spring or similar water source. Oases also provide habitat for animals and even humans if the area is big enough. The location of oases has been of critical importance for trade and transportation routes in desert areas. Caravans must travel via oases so that supplies of water and food can be replenished. Thus, political or military control of an oasis has in many cases meant control of trade on a particular route. For example, the oases of Awjila, Ghadames and Kufra, situated in modern-day Libya, have at various times been vital to both North-South and East-West trade in the Sahara. The word oasis came into English via Greek oasis, borrowed directly from Egyptian or Demotic. It was not borrowed from Coptic, as is sometimes suggested; the Greek word is attested several centuries before Coptic existed as a written language.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_CONCEPT_CONGRESSES_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[H1]Congresses[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]Congresses in Rhye's and Fall represent the phenomenon of informal institutionalization of international politics that began during the 19th century. This includes the idea of the balance of power which manifested itself in the Congress of Vienna and the Concert of Europe, but also international conferences on territorial claims such as the Berlin Congress. They also represent other diplomatic exchanges of territory like the Louisiana Purchase.[PARAGRAPH:2]Congresses take place as soon as the first civilization discovers Nationalism and regularly occur every 15 turns. The ten most powerful civilizations of the world will be invited, and each of them can either claim a city or request to found a colony on unsettled territory. If the majority of civilizations agrees, the request is granted and the city will change hands or a settler will be created on the demanded empty spot. While the human player can decide on claims by voting YES, NO or ABSTAIN, the AI will make its own decisions based on a variety of factors. These include the legitimacy of the claim (e.g. if the claimed city is historical for the civilization or if it already has culture there), the relationship to the demanding and controlling civilizations, including their own interest in the city.[PARAGRAPH:2]If a player claim was considered legitimate by an AI, but not granted because of insufficient relations, or if a player city has been granted to another civilization by the AI, the player can choose a number of options to influence the vote of AI civilizations in their favor. This can happen either through bribery (offering gold) or manipulation (expending espionage points). The player can spend varying amounts of both resources depending on how much they consider influencing their votes necessary. Another way to influence the AI is by agreeing to their own claims in the same congress - or at least avoiding to vote against them![PARAGRAPH:2]If all attempts fail and the congress still gives away one of your cities, you still have the opportunity to refuse handing it over. But be careful, this may cause some of the civilizations that agreed to the request to go to war over your contempt for their decision! The more votes were in favor of reassigning the city, the likelier an individual civilization is to go to war.[PARAGRAPH:2]Congresses are disrupted by global wars, under which different rules apply. A global war takes place when at least half the military power of the world is at war with each other. During these times, no congresses occur because the world is settling its differences on the battlefield instead of the negotiation table. However, when such a global war ends (by the main belligerents agreeing to peace), peace is enforced on all belligerents and a new congress is called to restore order after the war. Such a congress differs from normal congresses in that only belligerents are invited, that only civilizations on the winning side are allowed to make demands, and that it is impossible to request colonizing free territory. Civilizations that have lost the war still can vote on all claims, however. Congresses completely come to an end when the United Nations are built because their formalized approach to multilateral diplomacy makes congresses obsolete.
[NEWLINE]If you are familiar with Congresses from Rhye's and Fall, you will notice multiple significant changes and improvements over the previous system, some of which have already been mentioned:
[ICON_BULLET]In addition to periodic congresses, congresses can also occur after global wars
[ICON_BULLET]Participants can also request to settle free territory
[ICON_BULLET]A streamlined interaction process so that the entire congress can be resolved in one turn
[ICON_BULLET]Significant improvements in computation times
[ICON_BULLET]When voting on a claim, the camera centers on the plot or city in question
[ICON_BULLET]The option to influence a civilization's decision is only offered when there is actually a chance of success
[ICON_BULLET]Attempts to influence a decision are now specific to a certain claim and can be used both to achieve agreement to an own claim and disagreement with a claim on your own cities
[ICON_BULLET]There is no limit on how many civilizations can be attempted to be influenced during the same Congress
[ICON_BULLET]In addition to bribery by offering gold, votes can also be manipulated by expending espionage
[ICON_BULLET]More sophisticated AI decisionmaking: it now takes the legitimacy of the claim, its relations to the claimant and owner, and its own interest in the city into account
[ICON_BULLET]More global AI decisionmaking: your own voting behavior influences how the AI treats your claims and the claims against you, global opinion influences how likely AIs are to go to war over a refused claim
[ICON_BULLET]No more multiple assignments during the same Congress: if more than one civilization have successfully claimed the same city, it goes to the civilization that received the most votes in favor</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Prambanan temple is the largest Hindu temple of ancient Java, and the first building was completed in the mid-9th century. It was likely started by Rakai Pikatan as the Hindu Sanjaya Dynasty's answer to the Buddhist Sailendra Dynasty's Borobudur and Sewu temples nearby. Historians suggest that the construction of Prambanan probably was meant to mark the return of the Hindu Sanjaya Dynasty to power in Central Java after almost a century of Buddhist Sailendra Dynasty domination. The construction of this massive Hindu temple signifies that the Medang court had shifted its patronage from Mahayana Buddhism to Shivaite Hinduism.[PARAGRAPH:2]A temple was first built at the site around 850 CE by Rakai Pikatan and expanded extensively by King Lokapala and Balitung Maha Sambu the Sanjaya king of the Mataram Kingdom. According to the Shivagrha inscription of 856 CE, the temple was built to honor Lord Shiva, and its original name was Shiva-grha (the House of Shiva) or Shiva-laya (the Realm of Shiva). According to the Shivagrha inscription, a public water project to change the course of a river near Shivagrha temple was undertaken during the construction of the temple. The river, identified as the Opak River, now runs north to south on the western side of the Prambanan temple compound. Historians suggest that originally the river was curved further to east and was deemed too near to the main temple. The project was done by cutting the river along a north to south axis along the outer wall of the Shivagrha Temple compound. The former river course was filled in and made level to create a wider space for the temple expansion, the space for rows of pervara (complementary) temples.[PARAGRAPH:2]Some archaeologists propose that the statue of Shiva in the garbhagriha (central chamber) of the main temple was modelled after King Balitung, serving as a depiction of his deified self after death.[PARAGRAPH:2]The temple compound was expanded by successive Mataram kings, such as Daksa and Tulodong, with the addition of hundreds of perwara temples around the chief temple. Prambanan served as the royal temple of the Kingdom of Mataram, with most of the state's religious ceremonies and sacrifices being conducted there. At the height of the kingdom, scholars estimate that hundreds of brahmins with their disciples lived within the outer wall of the temple compound. The urban center and the court of Mataram were located nearby, somewhere in the Prambanan Plain.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Most Filipinos are a combination of Malay, Chinese, Negrito (native Filipino), and Spanish blood, but may also have a mix of Japanese and American. The racial mix originated from eras of differing foreign rule. The Negritos or Aeta ( the natives of the Philippines) were the original inhabitants of the islands. Following these hunter-gatherers was a breed that included the mix of Malays from deep southeast Asia. The Malays basically crept up starting from Mindanao. The Muslim culture stemming from Mindanao was thus born from the Malay migration. The next to step foot on Philippine soil would be the Chinese, or those originating from east Asia, as they migrated across the sea and intermixed with the natives and Malays of the Philippines.[paragraph:2]Horticulture and agriculture developed. Everything was relatively quiet until the 1500s when the Spaniards came upon the Philippines and desired to colonize it. Unfortunately for Spain, the Filipinos were not in the mood of being conquered. Ferdinand Magellan, a famous Spanish explorer credited for "discovering" the Philippines, was killed by Lapu-lapu, a famous Filipino chief credited for killing Magellan. Despite Filipino resistance, the Spanish eventually took over. Spanish rule over the Philippines would be a long one, from the 1500s to almost 1900. The Philippines' role as a key trade/base point was born. The Filipinos never did take a liking for Spanish rule, so they continued to rebel.[paragraph:2]Jose Rizal, the national hero of the Philippines, is credited for sparking the series of Filipino rebellions during the 1800s. Rizal basically made a habit of writing Philippine nationalist papers, which the Spanish did not like at all. Around the same time, another hero was born in Andres Bonifacio. So Rizal sat back and wrote papers that angered Spaniards, while Bonifacio fought and led Filipino rebellions against the Spanish that also angered the Spaniards. And so Rizal was executed, and not long after, Bonifacio was too.[paragraph:2]Emilio Aguinaldo took over as Filipino leader for a couple of years until the Spanish decided they wanted a ceasefire. Aguinaldo thought it was a good idea, so they organized an agreement that allowed Aguinaldo to go into exile and earn some money in the process. So at this point in time, the Philippines still technically belonged to Spain although Spaniard forces were taken out of the Philippines due to conflict in Cuba and with the US. The rebellions in the Philippines were at a standstill and Aguinaldo was out of the country spending Spanish pesos.[paragraph:2]The US, being at war with Spain during this time, saw this as a great opportunity to snatch the vulnerable Philippines. And so they sought about doing just that by attacking what little of the Spanish navy was left in Manila. This influenced Aguinaldo to go back and declare independence for the Philippines . By now Spain no longer saw any point in wasting any more time with the Philippines so they sold the Philippines to the US for 20 million dollars. The US took over from there and set the Philippines with a puppet government suited to their liking. Rebellions still occurred but were not effective. The outbreak of World War II resulted in the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. After the war, a lease was signed to permit US bases in the Philippines.[paragraph:2]The 1950s were relatively stable with the election of Ramon Magsaysay into power. Magsaysay tried to do good for the people but was lacking in funds. Ferdinand Marcos succeeded the throne during the 1960s and would keep the position until 1986. Macros took a good thing and got carried away with extremes. He proclaimed martial law to maintain his presidential position. Corazon Aquino followed as president at the end of Marcos' dictatorship.[paragraph:2]The Philippines exhibited some growth during the 1990s under the leadership of Fidel Ramos. Declining to run for re-election Fidel Ramos was succeeded by actor Joseph Estrada. Estrada's term unfortunately resulted in rampant political corruption and economic decline, which prompted his impeachment.Gloria Macapagal Arroyo followed as president of the Philippines.

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_POTALA_PALACE_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]The site on which the Potala Palace rises is built over a palace erected by Songtsen Gampo on the Red Hill. The Potala contains two chapels on its northwest corner that conserve parts of the original building. One is the Phakpa Lhakhang, the other the Chogyel Drupuk, a recessed cavern identified as Songtsen Gampo's meditation cave. Lozang Gyatso, the Great Fifth Dalai Lama, started the construction of the modern Potala Palace in 1645 after one of his spiritual advisers, Konchog Chophel (died 1646), pointed out that the site was ideal as a seat of government, situated as it is between Drepung and Sera monasteries and the old city of Lhasa. The external structure was built in 3 years, while the interior, together with its furnishings, took 45 years to complete. The Dalai Lama and his government moved into the Potrang Karpo ('White Palace') in 1649. Construction lasted until 1694, some twelve years after his death. The Potala was used as a winter palace by the Dalai Lama from that time. The Potrang Marpo ('Red Palace') was added between 1690 and 1694.[PARAGRAPH:2]The new palace got its name from a hill on Cape Comorin at the southern tip of India-a rocky point sacred to the bodhisattva of compassion, who is known as Avalokitesvara, or Chenrezi. The Tibetans themselves rarely speak of the sacred place as the "Potala", but rather as "Peak Potala" (Tse Potala), or most commonly as "the Peak".[PARAGRAPH:2]The palace was moderately damaged during the Tibetan uprising against the Chinese in 1959, when Chinese shells were launched into the palace's windows. Before Chamdo Jampa Kalden was shot and taken prisoner by soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, he witnessed "Chinese cannon shells began landing on Norbulingka past midnight on March 19th, 1959... The sky lit up as the Chinese shells hit the Chakpori Medical College and the Potala." It also escaped damage during the Cultural Revolution in 1966 through the personal intervention of Zhou Enlai, who was then the Premier of the People's Republic of China. Tibetan activist Tsering Woeser claims that the palace, which harboured "over 100,000 volumes of scriptures and historical documents" and "many store rooms for housing precious objects, handicrafts, paintings, wall hangings, statues, and ancient armour", "was almost robbed empty". On the other hand, tibetologist Amy Heller writes that "the invaluable library and artistic treasures accumulated over the centuries in the Potala have been preserved."[PARAGRAPH:2]The Potala Palace was inscribed to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1994. In 2000 and 2001, Jokhang Temple and Norbulingka were added to the list as extensions to the sites. Rapid modernisation has been a concern for UNESCO, however, which expressed concern over the building of modern structures immediately around the palace which threaten the palace's unique atmosphere. The Chinese government responded by enacting a rule barring the building of any structure taller than 21 metres in the area. UNESCO was also concerned over the materials used during the restoration of the palace, which commenced in 2002 at a cost of RMB180 million (US$22.5 million), although the palace's director, Qiangba Gesang, has clarified that only traditional materials and craftsmanship were used. The palace has also received restoration works between 1989 and 1994, costing RMB55 million (US$6.875 million).[PARAGRAPH:2]The number of visitors to the palace was restricted to 1,600 a day, with opening hours reduced to six hours daily to avoid over-crowding from 1 May 2003. The palace was receiving an average of 1,500 a day prior to the introduction of the quota, sometimes peaking to over 5,000 in one day. Visits to the structure's roof were banned after restoration efforts were completed in 2006 to avoid further structural damage. Visitorship quotas were raised to 2,300 daily to accommodate a 30% increase in visitorship since the opening of the Qingzang railway into Lhasa on 1 July 2006, but the quota is often reached by mid-morning. Opening hours were extended during the peak period in the months of July to September, where over 6,000 visitors would descend on the site.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The chariot was the earliest means of transportation in combat other than man's own powers of locomotion. The earliest known chariots, shown in Sumerian depictions from about 2500 BC, were not true chariots but four-wheeled carts with solid wooden wheels, heavy and cumbersome and lacking a pivoting front axle. The Hyksos apparently introduced the Assyrian chariot into Egypt shortly thereafter, where it was perfected for transportation and warfare. Within 500 years, Egyptian, Hittite and Palestinian chariots were extraordinarily light and maneuverable vehicles, the wheels and tires in particular exhibiting great sophistication in design and fabrication. Egyptian war chariots were drawn by either two or three horses, which were harnessed by means of chest girths secured by a pole and a yoke.[PARAGRAPH:1]The decline of the war chariot by the end of the 2nd millennium BC was probably related to the spread of iron weaponry, but it was surely related also to the breeding of horses with sufficient strength and stamina to carry an armed man into battle. Armed horsemen replaced the chariot in most Mediterranean civilizations. The use of chariots in war lingered in areas of slower technological advance, but in classical Egypt they were retained mainly for ceremonial functions.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_BLETCHLEY_PARK_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]Bletchley Park, also known as Station X, is an estate located in the town of Bletchley, now part of Milton Keynes, England. During World War II, Bletchley Park was the location of the United Kingdom's main codebreaking establishment. Codes and ciphers of several Axis countries were deciphered there, most famously the German Enigma. The high-level intelligence produced by Bletchley Park, codenamed Ultra, is frequently credited with aiding the Allied war effort and shortening the war, although Ultra's effect on the actual outcome of WWII is debated.[PARAGRAPH:2]Just before war broke out Biuro Szyfr&#243;w revealed Poland's achievements on decrypting German Enigma codes to British intelligence. The British used the information given to them by Poland as a basis for their own attempts to decrypt German Enigma signals. The "first wave" of the Government Code and Cypher School moved to Bletchley Park on 15 August 1939. The main body of GC and CS, including its Naval, Military and Air Sections was on the ground floor of the house, together with a telephone exchange, a teleprinter room, a kitchen and a dining room for all the staff. The top floor was allocated to MI6. The prefabricated wooden huts were still being erected, and initially the entire shooting party was crowded into the existing house, its stables and cottages. These were too small, so Elmers School, a neighbouring boys' boarding school was acquired for the Commercial and Diplomatic Sections (Smith, 1998 page 2-3).[PARAGRAPH:2]A wireless room was set up in the mansion's water tower and given the code name "Station X",a term now sometimes applied to the codebreaking efforts at Bletchley as a whole. Due to the long radio aerials stretching from the wireless room, the radio station was soon moved away from Bletchley Park, in order to not draw attention to the site.[PARAGRAPH:2]Listening stations - the "Y" Stations (such as the ones at Chicksands and Beaumanor Hall, the War Office "Y" Group HQ) - gathered raw signals for processing at Bletchley. Coded messages were taken down by hand and sent to Bletchley on paper by motorcycle couriers or, later, by teleprinter. Bletchley Park is mainly remembered for breaking messages enciphered on the German Enigma cypher machine, but its greatest cryptographic achievement may have been the breaking of the German "Fish" High Command teleprinter cyphers.[PARAGRAPH:2]The intelligence produced from decrypts at Bletchley was code-named "ULTRA". It contributed greatly to the Allied success in defeating the U-boats in the Battle of the Atlantic, and to the British naval victories of Battle of Cape Matapanand the Battle of North Cape.[PARAGRAPH:2]When the United States joined the war Churchill agreed with Roosevelt to pool resources and a number of American cryptographers were posted to Bletchley Park. Whilst the British continued to work on German cyphers, the Americans concentrated on the Japanese ones.[PARAGRAPH:2]The only direct action that the site experienced was when three bombs, thought to have been intended for Bletchley railway station, were dropped on 20-21 Nov 1940. One bomb exploded next to the dispatch riders' entrance, shifting the whole of Hut 4 (the Naval Intelligence hut) two feet on its base. As the huts stood on brick pillars, engineers just winched it back into position whilst work continued inside.[PARAGRAPH:2]An outpost of Bletchley Park was set up at Kilindini, Kenya to break and decipher Japanese codes. With a mixture of skill and good fortune, this was successfully done: the Japanese merchant marine suffered 90 per cent losses by August 1945, a result of decrypts.</English>

Later, Zhu Xi defined junzi as second only to the sage. There are many characteristics of junzi. Junzi' can live with poverty. Junzi does more and speaks less. A junzi is loyal, obedient and knowledgeable. Junzi disciplines himself. Among these, Ren is the core of becoming the junzi.[PARAGRAPH:1]As the potential leader of a nation, a son of the ruler is raised to have a superior ethical and moral position while gaining inner peace through his virtue. To Confucius, the junzi sustained the functions of government and social stratification through his ethical values. Despite its literal meaning, any righteous man willing to improve himself can become a junzi.[PARAGRAPH:1]On the contrary, the xiaoren (small or petty person") does not grasp the value of virtues and seeks only immediate gains. The petty person is egotistic and does not consider the consequences of his action in the overall scheme of things. Should the ruler be surrounded by xiaoren as opposed to junzi, his governance and his people will suffer due to their small-mindness. Examples of such xiaoren individuals can range from those who continually indulge in sensual and emotional pleasures all day to the career politician who is interested merely in power and fame; neither sincerely aims for the long-term benefit of others.[PARAGRAPH:1]The junzi enforces his rule over his subjects by acting virtuously himself. It is thought that his pure virtue would lead others to follow his example. The ultimate goal is that government behaves much like family. Thus at all levels filial piety promotes harmony and the junzi acts as a beacon for this piety.</English>

Many coffee houses in the Middle East, and in West Asian immigrant districts in the Western world, offer shisha (nargile in Turkish and Greek), flavored tobacco smoked through a hookah.[PARAGRAPH:2]From a cultural standpoint, coffeehouses largely serve as centers of social interaction: the coffeehouse provides social members with a place to congregate, talk, write, read, entertain one another, or pass the time, whether individually or in small groups of 2 or 3.</English>

By 1965, the Commission alone had 3,200 staff scattered across 8 different cramped buildings. The situation, which started as soon as they arrived due to the lack of large office blocks, became critical and the Commission tried to concentrate its staff in a number of rented buildings around Schuman roundabout. The Belgian government, becoming aware of the problem and keen to ensure that the Commission stayed, offered to build a prestigious administration complex large enough to house the entire staff. President Walter Hallstein was interested but cautious about making long-term commitments while the issue of where the institutions were based was still being discussed. However, the need for office space was overwhelming.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Belgian government's proposal required sufficient land which would preferably be in the Leopold Quarter (where they were already based) and near the homes of the civil servants to the south and east. The land chosen was then occupied by the Dames de Berlaymont, a 300-year-old convent which managed a venerable girls' school. The convent and school moved to a larger and quieter site out of the city centre in Waterloo. Once the Belgian state finished their new school and built infrastructure to it, the Dames de Berlaymont handed the site, which they had been under pressure to sell to developers for years, to the Belgian government in November 1963.[PARAGRAPH:2]To organise what was needed, the Belgian Foreign Minister Pierre Wigny suggested a "Commission consultative Berlaymont", where the Commission, the Belgian Public Works Ministry, the contractors and the architects could draw up the plans. However, the Belgian state desired a building not just tailored to the Commission, but something that could be used by its own civil servants were the Commission to leave. This was also why they favoured a central office building rather than the project for the construction of a "European city" on the Etterbeek.

It is best known as the location where Martin Luther started the Reformation, by nailing his Ninety-Five Theses to the doors of the church. The Ninety-Five Theses were an attack on the sale of indulgences by the Catholic Church. "Indulgences" were purchased by those Catholics who, having already obtained forgiveness for their sins, wished to reduce the time they would spend in punishment in the afterlife for their sins, before eventually going to heaven. In practice, these were sold to fund the expenses of the Catholic Church on salaries and construction projects. It was Luther's contention that this turned penitence into a commercial transaction.[PARAGRAPH:1]Past heresies in Christianity were quickly quashed by the Church, which excommunicated and even declared crusades against dissenters. However, the development of the printing press ensured the rapid spread of Luther's message throughout Europe. Luther's refusal to recant his condemnations of Rome is seen as the beginning of the process of the Protestant Reformation.</English>

Rising to the position of Chief in 1856, Sitting Bull was a key member of the native resistance against American encroachment into the Black Hills of the Dakota Territory.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sitting Bull was a precocious youth, taking to warfare and hunting like a fish to water. At ten, he slew his first buffalo. By the time he had reached middle adolescence, Sitting Bull had been inducted into the prestigious societies of the Strong Heart Warrior and the Silent Eater. A most dangerous and powerful warrior - despite walking with a limp from a bullet wound he suffered as a youth - Sitting Bull became a feared name among the Lakota, the young Chief leading his fellow Hunkpapa into numerous victories over other tribes.[PARAGRAPH:1]His expertise in warfare did not keep Sitting Bull from signing the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, which called for the halting of American expansion into Sioux territory beyond the Powder River. But with the discovery of gold in the Black Hills in 1874, a new rush of colonists from the East began violating the treaty. Sitting Bull is said to have had a prophetic dream regarding the American expansion - an American military officer and his men, plummeting from the sky into a Sioux village - which was interpreted as a portent of the Americans' imminent doom. Not long after Sitting Bull's vision, General George Custer and his seventh cavalry launched an attack on a native village, only to be decimated by the assembled Sioux and Cheyenne fighters.[PARAGRAPH:1]American wrath quickly fell upon Sitting Bull and his people, and they were forced to flee to Canada where, despite a reception worthy of a foreign dignitary, they were to remain but briefly. A dearth of resources in their new lands threatened the Lakota with starvation, forcing Sitting Bull to guide his people back to the United States in 1881, with the understanding that they would receive land, sustenance and peace in America.[PARAGRAPH:1]Upon his return to the United States, Sitting Bull and a number of his followers joined Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West show. Cody was able to provide a better standard of living than Sitting Bull and his Sioux brethren could expect to receive on the reservations to which they were now assigned, and a strong friendship formed between Cody and the native leader.[PARAGRAPH:1]In the final decade of the nineteenth century, the "Ghost Dance," a ritual promising to rid the natives of American influence once and for all, began to spread among the Sioux.  Tensions again grew between the Lakota and the American military, who had expressly forbade native religious rituals like the "Ghost Dance." Buffalo Bill stepped in to try and negotiate a peaceful truce, but none was to be had. Fearing Sitting Bull's involvement in the growing ritual, the Chief was arrested and assassinated by Indian policemen in 1890, just days before the American opposition to the "Ghost Dance" would bring about the infamous Massacre at Wounded Knee.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Zulu spearmen were warriors without peer in southern Africa, dispatching every force that they encountered until running up against the superior technology of the Europeans. The Zulus were organized for the first time by Shaka, who began forming spearmen into groups called "impi" even before he became the chief of his tribe. Impi warriors began training as early as the age of six, serving first as porters and servants, and when of age, the cadets were trained in the use of weapons. When Zulu males reached adulthood at age twenty, they would become full members of their warband.[PARAGRAPH:1]Zulu spearmen were expected to be able to outrun a horse, travel 50 miles a day on foot, and move silently through rough terrain. The difficult training that the Zulu warriors went through made them tougher and stronger than their opponents, who frequently outnumbered the Zulus in battle.[PARAGRAPH:1]When going into battle, the Zulu spearmen painted their faces with chalk and red ochre to make themselves more intimidating. They carried spears (called "ilkwa") made of wood with a long iron point. The ilkwa was a stabbing weapon, unlike its predecessor the javelin-like "assegai," which had been used for throwing. Along with the spear, Zulus would carry a medium-sized shield. As contact with Europeans became more frequent later in the nineteenth century, Zulu warriors also made use of muskets and rifles captured from the British, although the Zulus did not have the training to use them properly.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tactically, the soldiers of a Zulu impi often used Shaka's "bull horns" formation, which consisted a main force ("isifuba" or chest) and two wings on the sides ("izimpondo" or horns) designed to outflank the enemy. A fourth group of veterans would remain as a reserve in the rear.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Zulu spearmen formed an effective and highly-versatile army which proved to be almost invincible when facing other African forces. They traveled lightly and could move very fast (if not the 50 miles a day that they claimed), but they also packed enough force to disrupt heavy enemy formations. Shaka used hit-and-run techniques against the numerically-superior Ndwandwe in the 1820s and achieved complete victory in a series of engagements.[PARAGRAPH:1]However, the Zulu spearmen were no match for the Martini-Henry rifles and Maxim guns of the British army when they went to war in 1878. The technological rift could not be overcome with Zulu valor.</English>

		<Chinese>祖鲁是南部非洲最强悍的战士，他们能够横扫所遇到的每一个对手，直到面对掌握先进军事科技的欧洲人才失去了力量。祖鲁人是在沙卡的领导下开始崛起的，沙卡在继任部族首领之前即组建了新型的矛兵部队，称为“伊姆皮”（impi）。这支部队的战士从六岁起就开始训练，起先是担任仆役，然后才学习使用武器。祖鲁男子到20岁成年并正式加入战斗团队。[PARAGRAPH:2]祖鲁矛兵宣称在崎岖地形下的行进速度能与野马媲美，凭借双脚一天能走50英里。虽然经常面对占据数量优势的敌人，祖鲁战士所经受的严格训练使他们比对手更强壮、更凶悍。[PARAGRAPH:2]在战场上，祖鲁矛兵用白垩与赭石涂沫脸部，使自己看起来更加威武。他们的武器是矛（“伊基瓦”），矛杆为木制，装有长长的铁制矛尖。“伊基瓦”是刺杀型的武器，而其前身“阿塞盖”则是类似标枪的投掷型武器。祖鲁战士还配备一面中型盾牌。到19世纪后期，随着与欧洲人的接触日益频繁，祖鲁战士也开始使用从英军手里缴获的火枪和来复枪，但他们没有经过正规的火器训练。[PARAGRAPH:2]祖鲁军队通常使用沙卡所创造的“牛角”阵形作战，该阵形由担任主力的中央（“伊西弗巴”，即前胸）和负责包抄敌军的两翼（“伊基彭多”，即尖角）构成。另外还有一批老兵殿后作为预备队。[PARAGRAPH:2]祖鲁矛兵组成了一支具有强大战斗力和灵活性的大军，在面对其他非洲土著军队时几乎百战百胜。作为轻装部队，他们能以极快的速度行进（虽然可能达不到他们宣称的每天50英里），并能突破防御严密的敌方战阵。在19世纪20年代，沙卡采取袭扰战术对付拥有数量优势的恩德万德韦人，并赢得了辉煌的胜利。[PARAGRAPH:2]然而，在1878年对英国的战争中，祖鲁矛兵则完全不是装备马蒂尼-亨利式来复枪和马克沁式机枪的英军的对手。军事技术方面的巨大鸿沟是无法靠个人的勇气来弥补的。[PARAGRAPH:2]</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]A priest is a person who leads worshippers in performing religious ceremonies and rituals. The position was of extraordinary importance in early cultures, since men believed that their day-to-day survival depended upon the favor of the gods. The earliest priests were probably elderly men and women too infirm to hunt and gather, but revered for their holiness and wisdom. As the lines between the spiritual and physical were much less rigid than today, priests might also be the tribal healers or leaders.[PARAGRAPH:2]Many branches of Christianity, Hinduism and Buddhism still employ priests, and though their secular power is greatly diminished, in recent years priests have played important roles in getting societies to adopt social changes that benefit the people. In South America, priests are famous (or infamous) for their active participation in politics, while the late Pope John Paul II, the highest-ranking Roman Catholic priest, is given credit for hurrying the demise of the Soviet Union.</English>

Because of their speed, cavalry units were often used for reconnaissance missions and hit-and-run raids on enemy installations and troops. Although warriors fighting from horseback with a variety of weapons date back to ancient Egypt, horse-mounted cavalry as we generally think of it today actually began in the late 1700s. Under Napoleon, the cavalry became an elite force, frequently deployed simultaneously with foot soldiers to mask the movements of the main battle force.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cavalry were used extensively in the American Civil War, and in other conflicts throughout the mid to late 19th century. When the repeating rifle replaced earlier single-shot firearms, horse-mounted troops became easy targets for infantrymen. The South African War, from 1899 to 1902, was the last major conflict where cavalry played an important role. Today, the roles once performed by horse-mounted cavalry have been assumed by troops utilizing armored assault vehicles and aircraft.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_CIV_ZULU_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]The Zulu came from a group of peoples known as the Nguni, a linguistic subgroup of the Bantu family of languages. The Nguni had been migrating south for almost a thousand years before reaching the region of the White Umfolozi River around 1700 AD. It was here that the Zulu decided to settle and make their home, according to tradition in 1709. The Zulu are named after Zulu kaNtombhela, who was the founder and chief of the tribe.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Zulu were never more than one unremarkable small tribe among many - until the coming of the great warrior Shaka Zulu, who was born sometime around 1787. While growing up, Shaka was exiled by his father and found refuge with Digiswayo, the chief of another neighboring tribe. When his father died around 1816, Digiswayo helped Shaka succeed to the Zulu throne.[PARAGRAPH:2]Once in power Shaka instituted something of a military revolution among the Zulus, replacing the traditional "assegai" (a javelin-like throwing spear) with a shorter stabbing spear called the "lklwa." He also equipped his warriors with a larger shield which covered most of the soldier's body. This change in Zulu weaponry reflected Shaka's innovations in warefare: while previous battles had tended to be somewhat ritualistic - with much chanting and spear-throwing at a distance - and thus did not have decisive results, Shaka taught the Zulu to kill.[PARAGRAPH:2]Under Shaka's command, the Zulu warriors would close to melee range with their opponents, where their shorter stabbing spears were more effective than the opposition's throwing weapons. Shaka also taught his warriors to fight in a new tactical formation known as the "buffalo horns. Under this formation the center of the Zulu line would engage the enemy to hold them in position, while the right and left "horns" would move forward and envelop the enemy. Outflanked on right and left and equipped with inferior weapons, few enemies could stand up to the Zulu assault; the Zulu were soon terrorizing the neighboring tribes.[PARAGRAPH:2]Within a decade, Shaka had accumulated an army of 50,000 warriors, defeated all of the surrounding tribes, and was master over most of the interior of what is now South Africa. Shaka set up a new capital for the Zulu at Bulaweyo, but his arrogance and cruelty caused dissatisfaction among his people. In 1828 Shaka was assassinated by his half-brothers Dingane and Mhlangana. Dingane then immediately killed Mhlangana and began a purge of the pro-Shaka chieftains under his control.[PARAGRAPH:2]It was into this picture of chaos and violence that the European settlers first began appearing onto the scene in the 1830s. The first European settlement in the Zululand region was the English colony of Port Natal (modern Durban). An English missionary went to live with the Zulu in 1837, and was tolerated by King Dingane. However, at the same time a group of Boer settlers known as the "Voortrekkers" (or pioneers) were moving north across the Orange River into the now-empty lands which had been vacated by tribes fleeing the Zulu. Dingane had given the Voortrekkers permission to settle in the area, but in 1838 - either as the result of a misunderstanding or because Dingane had planned it from the start - the Zulus attacked the newcomers.[PARAGRAPH:2]This proved to be a huge mistake. At the Battle of Blood River, the Zulus vastly outnumbered their opposition, having 10,000 warriors fighting 400 Boers. Despite the odds, however, the Boers slaughtered their opponents, their firearms giving them an overwhelming advantage against their spear-wielding opponents. The Zulus were forced to allow the white men to settle in their territory, which became known as the Republic of Utrecht.[PARAGRAPH:2]Following the battle, there was a generation of uneasy peace between the Zulus and the growing British and Boer presence in the region. However, after the discovery of diamond mines in South Africa in 1878, the British cast covetous eyes on the Zulu land, and they began to look for an excuse to attack and displace the natives. Following a minor border dispute in 1878, the British declared war and invaded Zululand on three fronts.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Zulu warriors fought bravely (and much to the Europeans' shock managed to slaughter a British force at Isandlwana), but the British rifles and Maxim guns made the ferocity of individual Zulu warriors irrelevant, and the outcome of the war was never in doubt. The Zulu were defeated and Zululand was incorporated into British South Africa. King Cetshwayo was taken to London to meet Queen Victoria as an honored prisoner. However, the rest of the nation did not fare so well, and the Zulus spent the next century under British and Afrikaner domination, forced to live under the racist apartheid laws of South Africa.[PARAGRAPH:2]Following the fall of apartheid in the 1990s, however, today Zulus enjoy full citizenship rights in South Africa. Zulu is the most widely spoken language in the country, and with over 11 million people, the Zulus are the largest ethnic group in South Africa.[PARAGRAPH:2] </English>

		<Chinese>祖鲁人源自恩古尼人（南部非洲班图语系诸民族之一）。恩古尼人在近千年时间里不断向南迁徙，约在公元1700年（或1709年）到达白乌姆福洛济河流域并最终定居下来。“祖鲁”这一称谓得名于部族创立者及首领祖鲁·卡恩托姆伯拉。[PARAGRAPH:2]起初的祖鲁只是一个不起眼的小部族——直到伟大的勇士沙卡·祖鲁成为他们的领袖。沙卡出生于约1787年，是一个私生子，他在尚未成年时即被其父放逐，流落到邻近的姆特瓦部族，被首领丁吉斯瓦约收留。其父于约1816年去世，丁吉斯瓦约又帮助沙卡成为祖鲁首领。[PARAGRAPH:2]沙卡掌权之后，在整个祖鲁部族推行军事改革，淘汰了传统的投射型长矛“阿塞盖”，代之以刺杀型短矛“伊基瓦”。他还让手下的战士装备能保护整个躯体的盾牌。这些变革体现了沙卡的新战争理念：过去的部族战争还保存着某种仪式性质——交战双方吟唱歌谣，在远距离投掷标枪——实际杀伤作用十分有限，沙卡则要教会祖鲁人如何进行真正的杀戳。[PARAGRAPH:2]根据沙卡的要求，祖鲁战士必须迅速冲锋，与敌人进行肉搏战。在近战中，刺杀型短矛比投射型长矛更有杀伤力。沙卡还指导他的战士组成一种名为“牛角”的新式作战阵形。中央阵线负责阻止敌军前进，左右“牛角”则负责包抄敌军的侧翼，很少有敌人能够抵御这样强大的攻势。[PARAGRAPH:2]在十年时间内，沙卡聚集起一支五万人的大军，击败了所有邻近的部族，控制了今南非内陆的大部分地区。沙卡在布拉维约建立了祖鲁王国的新首都，但他的骄傲自大和残酷无情激起了许多臣民的不满。1828年，沙卡被他的异母兄弟丁冈和穆赫兰加纳阴谋刺杀，随后丁冈又杀死了穆赫兰加纳，并开始对支持沙卡的酋长们进行大清洗。[PARAGRAPH:2]在一片血腥与混乱之中，首批欧洲移民于19世纪30年代到达这里。在祖鲁地区（“祖鲁兰”）的首个欧洲移民城市是纳塔尔港（今德班）。一位英国传教士于1837年在丁冈国王的许可下深入祖鲁人的领地。而与此同时，一批布尔人（定居南非的荷兰移民后代）“先驱者”也向北渡过奥兰治河，进入因祖鲁人扩张战争而被逃离的原住民所抛弃的土地。丁冈同意他们在该处定居，但到了1838年——或是因为双方发生误会，或是因为丁冈早有预谋——祖鲁人又对这批新移民发动了进攻。[PARAGRAPH:2]事实证明祖鲁人犯下了一个巨大的错误。这场冲突史称“血河之战”，祖鲁人在数量上占据绝对优势：他们拥有10,000名战士，布尔人仅有400人。结果却成了一边倒的屠杀，祖鲁长矛完全不是布尔人火器的对手。最终祖鲁人被迫同意白人在自己的领地上定居，布尔人的“乌得勒支共和国”自此建立。[PARAGRAPH:2]血河之战后，祖鲁人、英国人和布尔人之间维持着并不稳定的和平状态。然而到了1878年，南非丰富的钻石矿藏被发现了，英国人贪婪的目光紧盯着这片土地，时刻寻找攻击并逐走原住民的借口。1878年，英国以一场微不足道的边境争端为由，从三个方向全面入侵祖鲁兰。[PARAGRAPH:2]祖鲁战士英勇地抵抗入侵者，他们在伊桑德瓦纳战役中歼灭了英军一个整团，令全欧洲感到震惊（塞爱维小提示：此役有1300余名英军阵亡，是长矛打败来复枪的真实战例），但英国人的来复枪和马克沁机枪使祖鲁人的勇气失去了意义，战争的结果是毫无悬念的。祖鲁人战败了，祖鲁兰并入了英属南非。祖鲁国王塞奇瓦约作为战俘被送往伦敦，受到维多利亚女王的礼遇。但他的臣民的命运则要悲惨得多，南非祖鲁人在英国人和土生白人的统治下遭受种族隔离制度的压迫。[PARAGRAPH:2]南非种族隔离制度直到20世纪90年代才最终取消，南非祖鲁人获得了完全的公民权。目前祖鲁语是南非最通用的语言，祖鲁族人口有1100万，是南非诸民族中最大的一个。[PARAGRAPH:2] </Chinese>

The southwestern part of the Iranian plateau participated in the wider Ancient Near East with Elam, from the Early Bronze Age. The Persian Empire proper begins in the Iron Age, following the influx of Iranian peoples which gave rise to the Median, Achaemenid, the Parthians, the Sassanid dynasties during classical antiquity.[PARAGRAPH:2]The southwestern part of the Iranian plateau participated in the wider Ancient Near East with Elam, from the Early Bronze Age. The Persian Empire proper begins in the Iron Age, following the influx of Iranian peoples which gave rise to the Median, Achaemenid, the Parthians, the Sassanid dynasties during classical antiquity.[PARAGRAPH:2]Once a major empire of superpower proportions, Persia as it had long been called, has been overrun frequently and has had its territory altered throughout the centuries. Invaded and occupied by Greeks, Arabs, Turks, Mongols, and others&#194;&#151;and often caught up in the affairs of larger powers&#194;&#151;Persia has always reasserted its national identity and has developed as a distinct political and cultural entity.[PARAGRAPH:2]Iran is home to one of the world's oldest continuous major civilizations, with historical and urban settlements dating back to 4000 BC. The Medes unified Iran as a nation and empire in 625 BC. The Achaemenid Empire (550-330 BC) was the first of the Iranian empires to rule from the Balkans to North Africa and also Central Asia. They were succeeded by the Seleucid Empire, Parthians and Sassanids which governed Iran for almost 1,000 years.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Islamic conquest of Persia (633-656) and the end of the Sassanid Empire was a turning point in Iranian history. Islamicization in Iran took place during 8th to 10th century and led to the eventual decline of the Zoroastrian religion in Persia. However, the achievements of the previous Persian civilizations were not lost, but were to a great extent absorbed by the new Islamic policy and civilization.[PARAGRAPH:2]After centuries of foreign occupation and short-lived native dynasties, Iran was once again reunified as an independent state in 1501 by the Safavid dynasty who established Shi'a Islam as the official religion of their empire, marking one of the most important turning points in the history of Islam. The Safavids ruled from 1501 to 1722 (experiencing a brief restoration from 1729 to 1736) and at their height, they controlled all of modern Islamic Republic of Iran, Republic of Azerbaijan and Republic of Armenia, most of Iraq, Georgia, Afghanistan, and the Caucasus, as well as parts of Pakistan, Turkmenistan and Turkey. Safavid Iran was one of the Islamic "gunpowder empires", along with its neighbours, the Ottoman and Mughal empires. The Safavid dynasty had its origin in the Safaviyya Sufi order, which was established in the city of Ardabil in the Azerbaijan region. It was of mixed ancestry (Kurdish and Azerbaijani, which included intermarriages with Georgian and Pontic Greek dignitaries). From their base in Ardabil, the Safavids established control over all of Greater Iran and reasserted the Iranian identity of the region, thus becoming the first native dynasty since the Sassanid Empire to establish a unified Iranian state. Despite their demise in 1736, the legacy that they left behind was the revival of Persia as an economic stronghold between East and West, the establishment of an efficient state and bureaucracy based upon &#194;&#147;checks and balances&#194;&#148;, their architectural innovations and their patronage for fine arts. The Safavids have also left their mark down to the present era by spreading Shi'a Islam in Iran, as well as major parts of the Caucasus, South Asia, Central Asia, and Anatolia.[PARAGRAPH:2]After several intermediate dynasties, Iran was united again under the Qajar dynasty. Like virtually every dynasty that ruled Persia since the 11th century, the Qajars came to power with the backing of Turkic tribal forces, while using educated Persians in their bureaucracy. In 1779, after brutally murdering Lotf Ali Khan, of the Zand dynasty, ruler of southern Persia, Agha Mohammad Khan, the leader of the Qajar tribe, set out to reunify Iran. In his quest for power, he razed cities, massacred entire populations, and blinded some 20,000 men in the city of Kerman because the local populace had chosen to defend the city against his siege.[PARAGRAPH:2] Increased European interest in Iran and the ravages of time destroyed the Qajar dynasty as well. By the 17th century, European countries, including Great Britain, Imperial Russia, and France, had already started establishing colonial footholds in the region. Iran as a result lost sovereignty over many of its provinces to these countries via the Treaty of Turkmenchay, the Treaty of Gulistan, and others. The Great Persian Famine of 1870-1871 is believed to have caused the death of 2 million persons. A new era in the History of Persia dawned with the Constitutional Revolution of Iran against the Shah in the late 19th and early 20th century. The Shah managed to remain in power, granting a limited constitution in 1906 (making the country a constitutional monarchy). The first Majlis (parliament) was convened on October 7, 1906. The discovery of oil in 1908 by the British in Khuzestan spawned intense renewed interest in Persia by the British Empire. Control of Persia remained contested between the United Kingdom and Russia, in what became known as The Great Game, and codified in the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, which divided Persia into spheres of influence, regardless of her national sovereignty. During World War I, the country was occupied by British and Russian forces but was essentially neutral. In 1919, after the Russian revolution and their withdrawal, Britain attempted to establish a protectorate in Iran, which was unsuccessful. Finally, the Constitutionalist movement of Gilan and the central power vacuum caused by the instability of the Qajar government resulted in the rise of Reza Shah Pahlavi and the establishment of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1925. In 1921 military coup established Reza Khan, a Persian officer of the Persian Cossack Brigade, as the dominant figure in the next 20 years. Seyyed Zia'eddin Tabatabai was also a leader and important figure in the perpetration of the coup. The 1921 overthrow was not actually directed at the Qajar monarchy; it was targeted at officials who were in power and actually had a role in controlling the government; the cabinet and others who had a role in governing Persia. In 1925, after being prime minister for a couple of years, Reza Shah became the king of Iran and established the Pahlavi dynasty.[PARAGRAPH:2] The end of the Pahlavi dynasty came with the Iranian Revolution of 1979. The revolution was populist, nationalist and later Shi'a Islamic. It was in part a conservative backlash against the Westernizing and secularizing efforts of the Western-backed Shah, and a liberal backlash to social injustice and other shortcomings of the ancien regime.

With a total height of 829.8 m (2,722 ft) and a roof height (excluding antenna) of 828 m (2,717 ft), the Burj Khalifa has been the tallest structure and building in the world since its topping out in 2009.[PARAGRAPH:2]Construction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004, with the exterior completed five years later in 2009. The primary structure is reinforced concrete. The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called Downtown Dubai. It is designed to be the centrepiece of large-scale, mixed-use development. The decision to construct the building is based on the government's decision to diversify from an oil-based economy, and for Dubai to gain international recognition. The building was originally named Burj Dubai but was renamed in honour of the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the United Arab Emirates, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan; Abu Dhabi and the UAE government lent Dubai money to pay its debts. The building broke numerous height records, including its designation as the tallest building in the world.[PARAGRAPH:2]Burj Khalifa was designed by Adrian Smith, of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, whose firm designed the Willis Tower and One World Trade Center. Hyder Consulting was chosen to be the supervising engineer with NORR Group Consultants International Limited chosen to supervise the architecture of the project. The design is derived from the Islamic architecture of the region, such as in the Great Mosque of Samarra. The Y-shaped tripartite floor geometry is designed to optimize residential and hotel space. A buttressed central core and wings are used to support the height of the building. Although this design was derived from Tower Palace III, the Burj Khalifa's central core houses all vertical transportation with the exception of egress stairs within each of the wings. The structure also features a cladding system which is designed to withstand Dubai's hot summer temperatures. It contains a total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators.</English>

A master of cavalry tactics, Alexander would hold them back during the opening part of the battle, committing them at the decisive point to charge the shaken foe, often leading the attack himself. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]Alexander's father, Philip of Macedon, created the Companions, who were originally his closest retainers, picked from the Macedonian nobility. As their numbers rose, additional young noblemen were recruited from Thessaly and other parts of the Greek world. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]The Companions were organized into "ilai" (wings) of about 200 men, under the command of close personal friends of the king. They generally wore the usual Boeotian helmet with plumes out the top, a dyed cloak and cuirass. Underneath, they wore linen or leather corslets reinforced with metal scales. They carried long thrusting spears and a short sword; few carried shields unless afoot. Occasionally, Alexander armed them with javelins for specific battles. Their mounts were the best that Greece had to offer - short, sturdy animals trained for war. The horses were partially armored, likely with leather skirts over their flanks and rumps. [PARAGRAPH:2:1]The legends of Alexander's Companions have grown with the telling over the centuries. Though their prowess has undoubtedly been exaggerated, it cannot be denied that they played a significant role in victorious battles such as Issus and Chaeronea.

		<English>[TAB]As Frontinus explains: "for four hundred and forty-one years from the foundation of the City, the Romans were satisfied with the use of such waters as they drew from the Tiber, from wells, or from springs...But there now run into the City: the Appian aqueduct, Old Anio, Marcia, Tepula, Julia, Virgo, Alsietina, which is also called Augusta, Claudia, New Anio". Rome's first aqueduct was in response to the growing city and population which may have suffered a prolonged drought and major sanitary issues which affected their existing water supplies.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Aqua Appia was the first test of Roman engineering of its type and is quite unsophisticated in comparison to Rome's ten other aqueducts. Raffaelo Fabretti, one of the first to excavate the Appia, characterises it as "The first fruits of Rome's Foresight and greatness". Nevertheless, the Appia was kept in use into the era of Augustus Caesar through regular maintenance, renovations and even an expansion. Little of the original material remains today and much of information on the aqueduct comes from Frontinus who was appointed as water commissioner and recorded the technical, and some historical, details of the Appia about one hundred years after its completion.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although there were no formal Roman predecessors for the Aqua Appia, there were plenty of examples that existed in the Greek and Etruscan world. Greek influence came from their use of terracota pipes that were laid along the bottom of a channel or a large tunnel. This technique relates to the Roman technique in that it uses a water channel within a larger tunnel. The difference between the two is the fact that the Romans began to favour masonry conduits rather than the terracotta pipes which were generally used by the Greeks throughout the history of their aqueducts. A. Trevor Hodge, in his book "Roman Aqueducts and Water Supply", mentions the possibility that the Romans could indirectly have been influenced by the Iranian qanat which is a tunnel driven into a hillside to tap an aquiferous stratum deep inside it. It is believed that the Etruscan water channel system, the cuniculi is a form of the qanat and Hodge asserts that since the Romans had contact with the Etruscans and openly adopted other aspects of their culture they could have been implementing techniques and skills that were originally of Eastern descent. Etruscan water channels are also generally believed to have a great amount of influence on the Roman Aqua Appia. Their expertise in underground tunnelling served the function of draining water rather than supplying water. Nevertheless, undoubtedly the Romans gained much practical knowledge in underground water channelling from the Etruscans. "After all, the earliest aqueduct at Rome, The Aqua Appia, was itself entirely underground and in engineering if not in purpose of function, can have differed little from an Etruscan cuniculis.</English>

The raw material may be natural, or synthetic using products of the chemical industry. The textile industry grew out of the industrial revolution in the 18th Century as mass production of yarn and cloth became a mainstream industry.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1734 in Bury, Lancashire, John Kay invented the flying shuttle - one of the first of a series of inventions associated with the cotton industry. The flying shuttle increased the width of cotton cloth and speed of production of a single weaver at a loom. Resistance by workers to the perceived threat to jobs delayed the widespread introduction of this technology, even though the higher rate of production generated an increased demand for spun cotton.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1761, the Duke of Bridgewater's canal connected Manchester to the coal fields of Worsley and in 1762, Matthew Boulton opened the Soho Foundry engineering works in Handsworth, Birmingham. His partnership with Scottish engineer James Watt resulted, in 1775, in the commercial production of the more efficient Watt steam engine which used a separate condensor.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1764, James Hargreaves is credited as inventor of the spinning jenny which multiplied the spun thread production capacity of a single worker - initially eightfold and subsequently much further. Others credit the original invention to Thomas Highs. Industrial unrest and a failure to patent the invention until 1770 forced Hargreaves from Blackburn, but his lack of protection of the idea allowed the concept to be exploited by others. As a result, there were over 20,000 Spinning Jennies in use by the time of his death. Again in 1764, Thorp Mill, the first water-powered cotton mill in the world was constructed at Royton, Lancashire, England. It was used for carding cotton.

Last of the Piast Dynasty, king of Poland from 1333, the son of Wladyslaw I the Short (Wladyslaw I Lokietek).[PARAGRAPH:2]Casimir is the only Polish king who did receive and maintain the title of the great in Polish history (Boleslaw I Chrobry was once also called the great, but not today), and the title is well deserved. When he received the crown, his hold on it was in danger, as even his neighbours did not recognise his title and instead called him "king of Krakow. The economy was ruined, and country was depopulated and tired with wars. At the time of his death, it had doubled in land area (mostly through joining lands in today's Ukraine, then Duchy of Halicz), grew prosperous, wealthy and had great prospects to the future. Although he is depicted as a peaceful king in children books, he in fact waged many victorious wars and was preparing other ones just before he died.[PARAGRAPH:2]He built many new castles, reformed the Polish army, as well as Polish civil and criminal laws. At the Sejm in Wislica, March 11, 1347, he introduced salutary legal reforms in the jurisprudence of his country. He sanctioned a code of laws for Great and Little Poland, which gained for him the title of "the Polish Justinian". He founded the University of Krakow although his death stalled the development of the university (and that's why today it is called Jagiellonian instead of Casimirian). He organised a meeting of kings in Krakow in 1364 which showed the wealth of Polish kingdom.[PARAGRAPH:2]Casimir was sonless. Apparently he deemed his own descendants either unsuitable to inherit or too young. Thus, and in order to provide a clear line of succession instead of problems of uncertainty, he arranged his sister Elisabeth, Dowager Queen of Hungary, and her son Louis, King of Hungary to be his successors in Poland. Louis was proclaimed polish king in Casimir's death in 1370, but Elisabeth held much of the practical power until her death in 1380.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Copper is a metal that has been used by humanity for over five millennia. Copper is a soft metal and in its natural state unsuited for lengthy use - copper swords and daggers become dull very quickly, for instance. It is attractive, however, and was commonly used for pendants, bracelets and other decorative artifacts. By around 3000 BC, it was discovered that melting a bit of zinc or tin with the copper produced a much harder and more useful product: bronze. Within a short period bronze weapons, armor, and tools were in widespread use, and thus the Bronze Age was born.[PARAGRAPH:1]Interestingly, bronze is actually a tougher metal than iron. The Bronze Age was succeeded by the Iron Age not because iron was a better metal, but because tin and zinc had become scarce.</English>

		<English>[H1]Ezana[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Axum[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 320 - c. 360 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Ezana was the first monarch of the Kingdom of Aksum to embrace Christianity, and the first after Za Haqala (possibly Zoskales) to be mentioned by contemporary historians, a situation that lead S. C. Munro-Hay to comment that he was "the most famous of the Aksumite kings before Kaleb." His childhood tutor, the Syrian Christian Frumentius, became head of the Ethiopian Church. A surviving letter from the Arian Roman emperor Constantius II is addressed to Ezana and his brother Saizana and requests that Frumentius be sent to Alexandria to be examined for doctrinal errors and be replaced by Theophilos the Indian; Munro-Hay assumes that Ezana either refused or ignored this request.[PARAGRAPH:2]Ezana also launched several military campaigns, which he recorded in his inscriptions. A pair of inscriptions on a stela in Ge'ez found at Mero&#235; is thought of as evidence of a campaign in the fourth century, either during Ezana's reign, or by a predecessor like Ousanas. While some authorities interpret these inscriptions as proof that the Aksumites destroyed the kingdom of Mero&#235;, others note that archeological evidence points to an economic and political decline in Mero&#235; around 300. Moreover, some view the stela as military aid from Aksum to Mero&#235; to quell the revolt and rebellion by the Nuba. However, conclusive evidence and proof to which view is correct is not currently available.[PARAGRAPH:2]On some of the Aksumite coins minted during Ezana's reign appears the motto in Greek TOYTOAPECHTHXWPA - "May this please the people". Munro-Hay comments that this motto is "a rather attractive peculiarity of Aksumite coinage, giving a feeling of royal concern and responsibility towards the people's wishes and contentment". A number of coins minted bearing his name were found in the late 1990s at archeological sites in India, indicating trade contacts in that country. A remarkable feature of the coins is a shift from a pagan motif with disc and crescent to a design with a cross. Ezana is also credited for erecting several stelae and obelisks.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_CIV_INDIA_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]The Indian subcontinent is the home of one of the world's oldest and most influential civilizations. From about 5000 BC, increasing numbers of settlements of subsistence agriculturalists began to appear throughout the Indus Valley; by 2600 BC some of these villages grew into urban centers, forming the basis for the early Harappan civilization, the peer of contemporary Egyptian and Babylonian civilizations. It was around this period that Hinduism, the world's oldest religion, began to take form. Unlike the Egyptians and Babylonians, however, a central state failed to form in India until a much later period. It was not until the Mauryan Period (325-185 BC) that the first Indian empire ruling most of the subcontinent took shape.[PARAGRAPH:2]Chandragupta Maurya was the warrior who carved out much of the territory that would form the Mauryan Empire. Using War Elephants to good effect, he defeated Alexander's successor Seleucus, the ruler of the eastern Greek holdings in Iran and India. It was under Chandragupta's grandson Asoka (272-232 BC), however, that the Mauryan Empire reached its height, covering the entire subcontinent except for the southern tip. Asoka's India possessed an elaborate administrative and tax-collecting system, and trade flourished due to his construction of roads. Asoka converted to Buddhism during his rule and gave up violent conquest in order to live a moral life. His ethical teachings can still be found inscribed on pillars and rockfaces across India today.[PARAGRAPH:2]A century later, the disintegration of the Mauryan empire gave rise to a number of feuding kingdoms, the Guptas and Pajputs in the north and Chola, Hoysalas and Pandyas in the south. These divided kingdoms were unable to stand against the coming Islamic tide. The first Arabic raids in the subcontinent were made along the western coast and in Sind during the 7th and 8th centuries, and there had been Muslim trading communities in India for decades beforehand. The permanent military movement of Muslims into northern India, however, dates from the late 12th century and was carried out by the Turkish dynasty that arose on the ruins of the Abbasid caliphate. Sultan Mahmud, who conducted more than 20 campaigns in India from 1001 to 1027 AD and established a large but short-lived empire, laid the road to conquest. By 1186 AD, the Mahmud realm had been destroyed by the Ghurids, who proceeded to conquer the Rajput kingdoms and establish a Muslim sultanate in Delhi, from which a series of able Turkish overlords ruled the north until 1526 AD.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Muslim states were themselves supplanted by the Islamic Mughul Empire (1526-1761 AD), founded by Zahir-ud-Din Muhammad Babur (1526-1530 AD). Babur was a Mongol, a fifth-generation descendant of Timur and a 14th-generation descendant of Genghis Khan. In a lightning series of campaigns commencing in 1511 AD, he overran the Punjab and Hindustan. Akbar the Great (1556-1605 AD), his grandson, continued the conquest of the subcontinent, overrunning Gujarat, Bengal and Rajasthan. At its zenith, the Mughal realm commanded resources unprecedented in Indian history and covered almost the entire subcontinent.[PARAGRAPH:2]The 16th and 17th centuries also saw the establishment and expansion of European trading organizations in the subcontinent, principally for the procurement of rare resources. By 1740, the Portuguese, Dutch, English, and French had all founded colonial trading posts, but after their defeat in the Seven Years War the French holdings were surrendered to the British East India Company. The collapsing Mughal Empire left a power vaccuum that the East India Company would step in and fill. Despite initially possessing no more than a handful of trading posts, the British soon won control of the rich province of Bengal, and continued their territorial expansion from there. Military adventurers using small numbers of British forces mixed with large numbers of Indian auxiliaries won a series of stunning victories against the dying Mughals and the independent princes of states such as Mysore, Rajputana, and the Maratha Confederacy. By 1850, the entire subcontinent was controlled by the British either directly or through alliances. The quarter-century following the bitter Indian revolt of 1857-59, which transferred the East India Company's rule to the British crown, ended with the birth of nationalist agitation.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Indian National Congress held its first meeting in December 1885 in Bombay even as Indian troops were fighting in upper Burma under the British flag. Mohandas Gandhi (1869-1948), later known as Mahatma ("Great-Souled"), was recognized throughout India as the spiritual leader of a nationwide movement for independence. The Jallianwala Bagh (1919) massacre turned millions of moderate Indians from patient and loyal supporters of the British Raj into fervent nationalists. The last years of British rule were racked by increasingly violent Hindu-Muslim conflict and intensified opposition to foreign rule. In July 1947, Britain's Parliament passed the Indian Independence Act, ordering the demarcation of the dominions of India and Pakistan by midnight of August 14, 1947, and dividing within a single month the assets of history's largest and richest colony. India today is the world's largest democracy, with a population estimated at over a billion, and despite widespread poverty is viewed as one of the world's rising powers.</English>

		<Chinese>印度次大陆是世界上最早和最具影响力的文明发源地之一。从大约公元前5000年起，越来越多的以农耕为生的聚居区开始出现在印度河谷中。到公元前2600年，其中的一些村落开始发展成城市中心，并形成了早期的哈拉帕文明的基础，基本与埃及文明和巴比伦文明同时代。在此期间，世界上最古老的宗教之一——印度教已开始产生。然而与埃及和巴比伦不同的是，这一地区建立起统一中央政权的时间要晚得多，直到孔雀王朝（前325-前185）时期才形成印度历史上首个范围基本涵盖整个次大陆的帝国。[PARAGRAPH:2]孔雀王朝的创立者旃陀罗笈多（前321-前297在位）是一位出色的军事领袖。他凭借战象的强大威力，击败了亚历山大希腊化大帝国的继承者之一，控制着印度西部和今伊朗地区的塞琉古斯。到旃陀罗笈多之孙阿育王在位时（前272-前232），孔雀王朝达到了强盛的巅峰，除最南端之外的整个印度次大陆都已成为帝国的领土。阿育王时代的印度建立了完善的行政和税收体系，商业贸易也因道路的兴建而兴旺发达。在统治的后期，阿育王皈依了佛教，放弃对外征战，过着远离尘世的生活。至今印度各地许多古迹的柱石上仍然镌刻着他的哲言和警句。[PARAGRAPH:2]一个世纪之后，孔雀王朝的瓦解形成了多个彼此长期争斗的王国，笈多和帕吉甫特位于北部，殊罗，何萨拉和潘德亚在南部，因为他们无法团结一致，将无法抵挡即将到来伊斯兰狂潮。阿拉伯对于次大陆最早的入侵的是从西部沿海和信得发起的，这些区域在此几十年前就已经成为了在印度的穆斯林贸易区。穆斯林的持续军事行动可以追溯到12世纪晚期，在阿拔斯哈里发王朝的废墟上建立起来的土库曼王朝的入侵行动。在1001到1027年间，马哈穆德苏丹征战印度多达二十余次，建立起了一个庞大但却短命的帝国，也为后来者铺就征服之路。1186年，古里人摧毁了马哈穆德所建的政权，随后又继续征服了拉吉普特王国，并且在德里建立了一个穆斯林苏丹国。此后这个国家多位贤能的土库曼裔君主统制着印度北部地区，直到公元1526年。[PARAGRAPH:2]穆斯林国家后来被札希尔-乌德-丁·穆罕默德·巴布尔（1526-1530在位）所建立的莫卧儿帝国（1526-1761）所取代。巴布尔是一个蒙古人，他是帖木儿的第五世孙，也是成吉思汗的第十四世孙。从公元1511年开始他发起了一系列的战役横扫了旁遮普和印度斯坦。他的孙子阿克巴大帝（1556-1605在位）继续进行对次大陆之路的征服，并控制了古吉拉特、孟加拉，以及拉吉斯坦等地。在莫卧儿帝国的全盛时期，所拥有的资源是印度史上空前的，也几乎控制了整个次大陆。[PARAGRAPH:2]16和17世纪可说是欧洲的贸易组织在次大陆生根并扩张的时期，这一切主要是为了获取珍稀资源。到1740年，葡萄牙人、荷兰人、英国人和法国人都在印度设立了殖民据点。不过在七年战争之后法国人的据点被迫向英属东印度公司投降。莫卧儿帝国的衰落在印度许多地区造成的权力真空，东印度东司乘虚而入。英国人的势力很快从最初的几个贸易站发展到完全富庶的孟加拉省，并以此为基地继续扩张。由少数英国人和大量当地族裔组成的东印度公司武装力量多次大败莫卧儿王朝以及一些独立邦国（如迈索尔，拉吉普塔纳和马拉塔联邦等）的军队。到1850年，整个印度次大陆都已处在英国直接或间接（通过联盟）的控制之下。但不久即爆发了席卷全印度的民族大起义（1857-1859），东印度公司的势力被英国国王的直接统治所取代，并促使印度民族主义力量不断觉醒。[PARAGRAPH:2]1885年12月，印度国民大会党于在孟买举行首次大会并宣告成立，尽管此刻印度军队还背着英国旗帜在缅甸作战。后来被人尊奉为“圣雄”的莫罕达斯·甘地（1869-1948）开始成为一场席卷印度的独立运动的精神领袖。发生在阿姆利则市札连瓦拉园的大屠杀（1919）将数以百万计的温和派印度人由忍让而忠诚的英国总督支持者转变成激进的民族主义者。在英国印度统治的最后几年里，整个印度充斥着印度教信徒和穆斯林的激烈冲突及对外国统治的强烈不满。1947年7月，英国国会通过《印度独立法案》，下令在1947年8月14日午夜将印度分为印度和巴基斯坦两个国家，并且在短短一个月内，将有史以来最广大富饶的殖民地一分为二。今日印度是世界上最大的民主国家，人口据估计已超过十亿，虽然贫穷现象依然普遍存在，但仍被世人看做是一个正在崛起的强国。</Chinese>

Some of his sons were massacred as well; one of the surviving sons was sent as a prisoner to Mongolia, where Mongolian historians report he married and fathered children, but played no role in Islam thereafter.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Travels of Marco Polo reports that upon finding the caliph's great stores of treasure which could have been spent on the defense of his realm, Hulagu Khan locked him in his treasure room without food or water, telling him "eat of thy treasure as much as thou wilt, since thou art so fond of it."</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]A Charreada is a Mexican-style rodeo that is different from other rodeos. The Mexican cowboy or cowgirl is known as a charro or charra. In an American rodeo the competitors race against the clock, so the emphasis is on speed in any given event. On the other hand, in a Mexican charreada the excellent style and skills of the rider or roper are emphasized, and only one event is timed.[PARAGRAPH:1]Charrer&#237;a (a word encompassing all aspects of the art) came to Mexico from Salamanca, Spain, in the 16th century. Interesting is the fact that when the Spaniards first settled in Mexico they were under the orders of the ruler to raise horses, but not to allow the Mexicans to ride them. By 1528 the Spaniards had very large cattle-raising estates. They soon found it necessary to employ the Mexicans as vaqueros or herdsman, and the natives soon became excellent horsemen. Small landholders, known as rancheros or ranchers, were the first genuine charros and invented charreadas.</English>

He brought nearly all of India (plus Afghanistan and Baluchistan) under one rule for the first (and thus far, only) time in history. Despite his great military prowess, Asoka grew weary of war; and over time he became disgusted at its stupidity and pointlessness.[PARAGRAPH:2]A popular young general and statesman, Asoka ascended to the Mauryan throne upon his father's death in 273 BC, at the approximate age of 26. He began his rule as a conqueror, seeking to expand his nation's power across the Indian subcontinent and beyond. He was quite successful, and his empire grew.[PARAGRAPH:2]However, after his bloody conquest of the Kalinga state in which over 100,000 people died and another 150,000 were injured, Asoka underwent a great spiritual change. Deeply remorseful for all of the suffering he had caused, he abandoned wars of conquest and accepted Buddhism. He turned from expansion and instead concentrated upon improving the spiritual and physical well-being of his people. He modified many of his country's harsh laws, and he advocated tolerance of all faiths. He built many Buddhist monasteries throughout the land, and the arts flourished under his rule. He sent Buddhist missionaries across the known world, including to faraway places like Greece and Egypt. Despite his fervent belief in Buddhism, Asoka demanded religious tolerance in his kingdom, saying, "Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Asoka desires that all religions should reside everywhere, for all of them desire self-control and purity of heart."[PARAGRAPH:2]Asoka died in 232 BC, and the empire he built lasted only fifty years after his death. His name would be virtually lost to history now, if it weren't for the discovery of a large number of columns and boulders inscribed with his words and teachings. These "Edicts of Asoka" contain not only a fount of information about King Asoka, showing him as a wise and thoughtful ruler, but they also provide invaluable knowledge of the early teachings and beliefs of Buddhism. </English>

Titles such as hazarmard ("whose strength is equal to one thousand men"), zih asbar ("superior rider"), and pahlawan-i gehan ("hero/champion of the world"), were their epithets. They wrote the name of the Sasanian emperor and their valuable family members on their arrows as a good omen. They outperformed others in archery to the extent that later writers thought that they had introduced the profession.

A number of lens-shaped crystals were found in a Viking grave dating from the 10th Century, but there is debate over whether these were purely decorative or were used to enhance vision.

A scion of the politically powerful Bhutto family, she was the eldest daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, a former prime minister himself who founded the centre-left Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). She was the first woman to become democratically elected head of any Muslim nation.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1982, three years after her father's execution, 29-year-old Benazir Bhutto became the chairperson of the PPP-a political party, making her the first woman in Pakistan to head a major political party. In 1988, she became the first woman to be elected as the head of an Islamic state's government; she also remains Pakistan's only female prime minister. Noted for her charismatic authority and political astuteness, Bhutto drove initiatives for Pakistan's economy and national security, and she implemented capitalist policies for industrial development and growth. In addition, her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation (particularly of the financial sector), flexible labour markets, the denationalisation of state-owned corporations, and the withdrawal of subsidies to others. Bhutto's popularity waned amid recession, corruption, and high unemployment which later led to the dismissal of her government by conservative President Ghulam Ishaq Khan.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1993, Bhutto was elected for a second term after the 1993 parliamentary elections. She survived an attempted coup d'锟絫at in 1995, and her hard line against the trade unions and tough rhetorical opposition to her domestic political rivals and to neighbouring India earned her the nickname "Iron Lady"; she was also respectfully referred to as "BB". In 1996, charges of corruption levelled against her led to the final dismissal of her government by President Farooq Leghari. Bhutto conceded her defeat in the 1997 Parliamentary elections and went into exile in Dubai in 1999. Nine years later, in 2007, she returned to Pakistan, having reached an understanding with President Pervez Musharraf, who granted her amnesty and withdrew all corruption charges against her. Bhutto was assassinated in a bombing on 27 December 2007, after leaving PPP's last rally in Rawalpindi, two weeks before the scheduled 2008 general election in which she was the leading candidate. Her party subsequently won the elections on a wave of sympathy generated by her assassination.</English>

There is purportedly a movement underway to reconstruct the tower. As of 2010, reconstruction of the tower and temple grounds went underway. The projected completion date of the first phase of reconstruction is 2014.[PARAGRAPH:1]The original blocks of the Nanjing Tower's arched door, now pieced back together and on display at the Nanjing Museum[PARAGRAPH:1]The Porcelain Tower of Nanjing was designed during reign of the Yongle Emperor (r. 1402-1424) shortly before its construction, in the early 15th century. It was first discovered by the Western world when European travelers like Johan Nieuhof visited it, sometimes listing it as one of the Seven Wonders of the World. After this exposure to the outside world, the tower was seen as a national treasure to both locals and other cultures around the world.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1801, the tower was struck by lightning and the top three stories were knocked off, but it was soon restored. The 1843 book The Closing Events of the Campaign in China by Granville Gower Loch contains a detailed description of the tower as it existed in the early 1840s. In the 1850s, the area surrounding the tower erupted in civil war as the Taiping Rebellion reached Nanjing and the Taiping Rebels took over the city. They smashed the Buddhist images and destroyed the inner staircase to deny the Qing enemy an observation platform. American sailors reached the city in May 1854 and visited the hollowed tower. In 1856, the Taiping destroyed the tower in order to prevent a hostile faction from using it to observe and shell the city. After this point, the tower's remnants were forgotten and it lay dormant until a recent surge to try to rebuild the landmark.[PARAGRAPH:1]The original blocks of the Nanjing Tower's arched door, now pieced back together and on display at the Nanjing Museum[PARAGRAPH:1]The tower was octagonal with a base of about 97 feet (30 m) in diameter. When it was built, the tower was one of the largest buildings in China, rising up to a height of 260 feet (79 m) with nine stories and a staircase in the middle of the pagoda, which spiraled upwards for 184 steps. The top of the roof was marked by a golden pineapple. There were originally plans to add more stories, according to an American missionary who in 1852 visited Nanjing. There are only a few Chinese pagodas that surpass its height, such as the still existent 275-foot-tall (84 m) 11th-century Liaodi Pagoda in Hebei or the no longer existent 330-foot-tall (100 m) 7th-century wooden pagoda of Chang'an.[PARAGRAPH:1]The tower was built with white porcelain bricks that were said to reflect the sun's rays during the day, and at night as many as 140 lamps were hung from the building to illuminate the tower. Glazes and stoneware were worked into the porcelain and created a mixture of green, yellow, brown and white designs on the sides of the tower, including animals, flowers and landscapes.

He also captured the southern half of China, reunifying the country under one rule and taking for himself the title of "Emperor."[PARAGRAPH:2]Ascending to the throne in 1260 at around the age of 45, Kublai was revealed to be a shrewd and skilled political leader. As Emperor of China, he followed his father's precepts of being gentle with the subject peoples in order to keep them happy; he restored many of the Chinese traditions and institutions that his predecessors had banned. Further, Kublai returned much political control back to the native people, and he reinstated numerous Confucian rituals and ceremonies at court. He also commissioned many public works, including the repair of the Grand Canal and extending China's highway system. Through these actions he secured his throne, allowing him to turn his attention to conquering the southern half of China, which was under the control of the Sung dynasty.[PARAGRAPH:2] Southern China was a tough shell to crack. Her terrain was unsuitable for the Mongol light cavalry; the heart of its army, the climate was cold and wet; and its huge cities were quite difficult to take by the Mongol's usual siege tactics and weapons. Kublai considered the problem and eventually came up with an innovative solution, particularly for the leader of nomadic horse warriors; he decided that he would attack the Sung Empire from the sea. As quickly as possible he trained his forces in the ways of naval warfare. He grouped his troops with native Chinese sailors, and he actively recruited deserters from the Sung naval forces. When the time was right he opened a series of campaigns against the coastal cities, and then moved inland to the Sung capital, Lin-an, which fell in 1276. The contest was decided in a sea battle, in which the final Sung emperor drowned as his forces were destroyed.[PARAGRAPH:2]Kublai Khan's later campaigns were rather less successful. Seeking to conquer Japan, in 1281 Kahn assembled two invasion fleets carrying about 140,000 troops to take on the islanders. The ships rendezvoused off of the Japanese coast as planned, but before they could offload the troops they were hit by a major typhoon, causing the loss of about half the men and ships. The expedition ended in failure as the dazed survivors limped home. A similar venture in 1292 to subjugate Java suffered a similar fate; this time the invaders landed safely and managed to capture and hold the island, but the occupiers were prostrated by the heat and ravaged by tropical disease. Many died, and within a year most of the survivors fled for the cooler climes of home.[PARAGRAPH:2]Kublai died in 1294, shortly after the Java campaign came to its dismal end. His record is mixed; he is usually judged to be a fair and able administrator who conquered China and improved the lives of many of his subjects. Militarily, he succeeded in his most important campaign, the conquest of southern China, but failed miserably in others.  </English>

The miller was the original food processing entrepreneur, turning inedible wheat into versatile flour, all while pulling in a tidy profit. Understandably, many modern food processing companies rose from the milling industry, often picking up a few new subsidiaries along the way. Today's food processors deal in a diverse range of consumer products, lining the walls of the local supermarket with everything from mayonnaise to deodorant.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Mayan Empire blossomed within the thick jungles and volcanic hills of Belize, Guatemala and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. Creators of the most advanced civilization in the Americas from 700 BC until 900 AD, the Mayan population in its age was second only to the Chinese T'ang dynasty in sheer numbers.[PARAGRAPH:2]Often referred to as the "Greeks of the New World," the Mayans were similarly organized into a series of feuding city states, although these cities served more religious and administrative purposes than as populations centers. Uniting the Maya culture was a common language, religion and artistic style, but each city state remained fiercely independent, often uniting only at the point of a Holkan spear.[PARAGRAPH:2]Every city-state was governed by its own royal family, whom often claimed full or semi-divinity. During the Mayan Classical Period from roughly 250 to 900 AD, these cities became vast complexes of pyramids, causeways and plazas. Nakbe, the first city-state to grow on a grand scale, began its expansion around 700 BC. By 300 BC, Nakbe had been transformed into an impressive city, with four grand step pyramids and a seven mile stone causeway linking it to the nearby city of El Mirador.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nakbe was only the first of many vast cities. Chichen Itza, Tikal and Palenque all became massive population centers. With myriad pyramids and religious structures, Tikal grew to become a city of the grandest scale and the largest of the Mayan population centers, dwarfing Palenque and Copan.[PARAGRAPH:2]Palenque, a significantly smaller settlement to the West, reached its zenith in the seventh century AD under the reign of Pakal I, whose subjugation of neighboring cities ensured the hegemony of his own. Much is known about Pakal and his city thanks to the intricately-carved history left to us within Pakal's tomb, "The Temple of Inscriptions," entire walls of which were filled with the Mayans' distinctive pictographic language, the only written language developed in the Americas.[PARAGRAPH:2]Language was not the only realm in which Mayan minds excelled. Their calendars were nearly on par with those of the modern era, but were created without the use of the telescope or other tools. Independent development of the number zero, an accomplishment that eluded both the Greeks and Romans, was yet another of the impressive feats of the Mayans.[PARAGRAPH:2]Most of these discoveries grew out of the Mayan religion. And while certainly interested in knowledge, the Mayan religion was ensconced in the belief of the power of blood. Many wars among the Maya were fought simply to provide prisoners to be sacrificed in intricate religious ceremonies, thought necessary to ensure the safety and advancement of the people.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Mayan civilization came to a surprisingly abrupt end, and the cause of this fall is still a hotly debated topic. One of the most widely-accepted theories is that the delicate ecology of the Yucatan rainforests simply could no longer support the growing population of the Mayan people. A peasant revolt is also a likely cause of the fall of Mayan priestly caste, as belief in brutal Mayan rituals fell to the wayside.[PARAGRAPH:2]But the popular notion that the Mayans simply disappeared is false. While the grand temple building, intricate carvings and sacrifices ceased, the Mayan language and people continued to survive in their former homeland, even after the conquest of their country by Spanish conquistadors. The Mayan languages, Yucatec being the most common, are still spoken to this day and armed resistance by the Maya continued into the twentieth century. The Maya remain a living people.</English>

		<Chinese>玛雅帝国兴起于今伯利兹、危地马拉和墨西哥的尤卡坦半岛，那里是被火山环绕的遍布着深深丛林的地方。在公元前700年到公元900年期间，玛雅是美洲大陆最高度文明的缔造者，期间，玛雅的人口数量仅仅亚于中国的唐朝，居世界第二。[PARAGRAPH:1]玛雅常被称为“新大陆的希腊”，尽管更多的用宗教方式来管理这些人口中心，玛雅还是同样存在着城邦不和谐的系列问题。尽管用统一语言、统一宗教、统一艺术形式的手段去试图统一玛雅文化，但是各个城邦依旧存在着强烈的独立情绪，因此将这些城邦结为一体就成为玛雅“霍坎武士”（Holkan）的重要职责。[PARAGRAPH:1]每个城邦都由各自的王族所统治，这些王族通常宣称自己是半神之身甚至神的化身。大约公元250年到公元900年期间的玛雅古典时代，这些城邦遍布金字塔，铺石路和花园广场。从大约公元前700年，纳克贝城，成长为第一座具有巨大规模的城市，并开始向周边扩张。到了公元前300年，纳克贝城已经俨然一座具备重要影响的城市，拥有四座巨阶金字塔，并用豪华的铺石路一直铺到埃尔-米拉多，足有七英里长。[PARAGRAPH:1]纳克贝城仅仅是众多大城市之一。奇琴伊察城，蒂卡尔城和帕伦克城都是具有众多人口的城市。拥有无数金字塔和宗教建筑的蒂卡尔城逐渐成为了规模最大的人口中心，而帕伦克城和科潘城逐渐退出了竞争。[PARAGRAPH:1]帕伦克城是座落于西面的一座稍小些但是引人注目的城市，在公元七世纪帕卡尔二世统治时期到达顶峰。帕卡尔二世镇压了周边城市的暴动，确保了自己的霸权地位。我们对帕卡尔的了解，要归功于帕卡尔墓――铭文神庙，庙墙上面书写着玛雅文化的沧桑历史。而书写用的文字则是玛雅独一无二的象形文字，唯一一种由美洲原住民所创造的文字。[PARAGRAPH:1]语言并不是玛雅王国唯一骄傲的东西。她的历法跟现代历法具有同等价值，但是玛雅历法的制订并没有使用过天文望远镜或者类似的工具。完全从零开始，丝毫没参考过希腊和罗马的历法，这是另一个让人刮目相看的玛雅成就。[PARAGRAPH:1]绝大多数的发现演变成玛雅宗教。但是出于对这些发现的认知程度，玛雅宗教认为都是因为“血的力量”。所以，很多玛雅的战争仅仅是为了掠夺俘虏，用来进行各种形式的祭祀活动，以确保自己人民的安全和优势地位。[PARAGRAPH:1]令人不解的是玛雅文明却突然消失了，这一直是人们谈论的热点话题。比较广泛接受的观点是，尤卡坦半岛的雨林生态环境无法支撑那么多人口的玛雅人。农民起义也极为可能是诱因之一，他们反对残酷的玛雅宗教仪式，导致了玛雅僧侣阶级的垮台。[PARAGRAPH:1]然而说玛雅人消失了的说法肯定是不正确的。当西班牙征服者的铁蹄征服了玛雅王国后，纵然巨庙建筑，精美的雕刻品和祭祀活动不再，玛雅语言和人民却依旧生存在他们从前的土地上。玛雅的一些语言，比如尤卡坦语至今仍然被广泛使用，而且玛雅人民的抵抗一直没有间断，一直持续到二十世纪。玛雅人至今仍然生活着。</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]An early version of the welfare state appeared in China during the Song Dynasty in the 11th century. Prime Minister Wang Anshi believed that the state was responsible for providing its citizens the essentials for a decent living standard. Accordingly, under his direction the state initiated agricultural loans to relieve the farming peasants. He appointed boards to regulate wages and plan pensions for the aged and unemployed. These reforms were known as the "new laws," New Policies, or xin fa.[PARAGRAPH:2]Modern welfare states developed through a gradual process beginning in the late 19th century and continuing through the 20th. They differed from previous schemes of poverty relief due to their relatively universal coverage. The development of social insurance in Germany under Bismarck was particularly influential. Some schemes, like those in Scandinavia, were based largely in the development of autonomous, mutualist provision of benefits. Others were founded on state provision. The term was not, however, applied to all states offering social protection. The sociologist T.H. Marshall identified the welfare state as a distinctive combination of democracy, welfare and capitalism.[PARAGRAPH:2]Examples of early welfare states in the modern world are Sweden (Folkhemmet), Germany, the Netherlands, and New Zealand in the 1930s. Germany is generally held to be the first social welfare state. Changed attitudes in reaction to the Great Depression were instrumental in the move to the welfare state in many countries, a harbinger of new times where "cradle-to-grave" services became a reality after the poverty of the Depression. During the Great Depression, it was seen as an alternative "middle way" between communism and fascism. In the period following the Second World War, many countries in Europe moved from partial or selective provision of social services to relatively comprehensive coverage of the population.[PARAGRAPH:2]The activities of present-day welfare states extend to the provision of both cash welfare benefits (such as old-age pensions or unemployment benefits) and in-kind welfare services (such as health or childcare services). Through these provisions, welfare states can affect the distribution of wellbeing and personal autonomy among their citizens, as well as influencing how their citizens consume and how they spend their time.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the discovery and inflow of the oil revenue, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and United Arab Emirates all became welfare states. However, the services are strictly for citizens and these countries do not accept immigrants; even those born in these countries do not qualify for citizenship unless they are of the parentage belonging to their respective countries.[PARAGRAPH:2]The beginning of the modern welfare state was in 1911 when David Lloyd George suggested everyone in work should pay national insurance contribution for unemployment and health benefits from work.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1942, the 'Social Insurance and Allied Services' was created by Sir William Beveridge in order to aid those who were in need of help, or in poverty. Beverage worked as a volunteer for the poor, and set up national insurance. He stated that 'All people of working age should pay a weekly national insurance contribution. In return, benefits would be paid to people who were sick, unemployed, retired or widowed.' The basic assumptions of the report were the National Health Service, which provided free health care to the UK. The Universal Child Benefit was a scheme to to give child benefits, which encouraged people to have children so they could afford to keep them alive and not for them to starve to death. This was particularly useful after the second world war, where the population in England declined, so encouragement for new babies was encouraged, which sparked the baby boom. The impact of the report was huge and 600,000 copies were made. He recommended to the government that they should find ways of tackling the five giants, being Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness. He argued to cure these problems, the government should provide adequate income to people, adequate health care, adequate education, adequate housing and adequate employment. Before 1939, health care had to be paid for, this was done through a vast network of friendly societies, trade unions and other insurance companies which counted the vast majority of the UK working population as members. These friendly societies provided insurance for sickness, unemployment and invalidity, therefore providing people with an income when they were unable to work. But because of the 1942 Berveridge Report, in 5th July 1948, the National Insurance Act, National Assistance Act and National Health Service Act came into force, thus this is the day that the modern UK welfare state was founded.</English>

		<Chinese>[表]11世纪宋朝时期，福利国家在中国出现了一个早期版本。王安石总理认为，国家有责任为公民提供体面生活的必需品。因此，在他的指导下，国家开始发放农业贷款，以减轻农民的负担。他任命董事会管理工资，为老年人和失业者制定养老金计划。这些改革被称为“新法律”、“新政策”或“新发”。[第2段]现代福利国家从十九世纪下旬开始逐步发展并延续到第二十。它们与以往的扶贫计划不同，因为它们的覆盖面相对较广。俾斯麦领导下的德国社会保险的发展尤其具有影响力。一些计划，如在斯堪的纳维亚半岛的计划，主要是基于发展自主的互惠互利的福利。另一些则建立在国家规定的基础上。然而，这一术语并不适用于所有提供社会保护的国家。社会学家T.H. Marshall认为福利国家是民主、福利和资本主义的独特组合。[段：2 ]现代世界早期福利国家的例子是瑞典（FokHimeT）、德国、荷兰和新西兰在20世纪30年代。德国通常被认为是第一个社会福利国家。由于对大萧条的反应而改变的态度有助于许多国家走向福利国家，预示着在大萧条贫穷之后，“从摇篮到坟墓”的服务成为现实的新时代。在大萧条时期，它被视为共产主义和法西斯之间的另一条“中间道路”。在第二次世界大战之后，欧洲的许多国家从部分或选择性地提供社会服务到相对全面的人口覆盖。[第2段]现行福利国家的活动扩展到提供现金福利福利（如养老金或失业救济金）和实物福利服务（如健康）。或儿童保育服务）。通过这些规定，福利国家可以影响公民的福利和个人自治的分配，以及影响他们的公民如何消费和如何度过他们的时间。[段：2 ]在石油收入的发现和流入之后，沙特阿拉伯、科威特和阿拉伯联合酋长国都成为福利国家。但是，这些服务是严格为公民提供的，这些国家不接受移民；即使那些出生在这些国家的人也不享有公民资格，除非他们属于属于他们各自国家的父母。[第2段]现代福利国家的开始是在1911，戴维·劳合·乔治建议每个人都应该为失业和健康福利缴纳国家保险费。第1942段，“社会保险和联合服务”是由威廉·贝弗里奇爵士创造的，以帮助那些需要帮助或贫困的人。饮料公司是一个为穷人服务的志愿者，并建立了国家保险。他说，所有工作年龄的人都应该每周缴纳国家保险费。作为回报，福利金将支付给生病、失业、退休或丧偶的人。这份报告的基本假设是国家卫生服务局（National Health Service），它为英国提供免费医疗服务。普遍儿童福利是一个给予儿童福利的计划，它鼓励人们生孩子，这样他们就可以养活他们，而不是让他们饿死。这在第二次世界大战后尤其有用，当时英国人口减少，所以鼓励生孩子，这引发了婴儿潮。这份报告影响巨大，共印了60万份。他向政府建议，他们应该想方设法解决五大问题：匮乏、疾病、无知、肮脏和懒惰。他认为，要解决这些问题，政府应该为人民提供足够的收入、适当的医疗保健、适当的教育、适当的住房和适当的就业。1939年以前，医疗保健必须付费，这是通过一个由友好社会、工会和其他保险公司组成的庞大网络完成的，这些公司将英国绝大多数劳动人口算作会员。这些友好社会为疾病、失业和残疾提供保险，从而在人们无法工作时为他们提供收入。但由于1942年的伯维里奇报告，1948年7月5日，《国家保险法》、《国家援助法》和《国家卫生服务法》正式生效，这是现代英国福利国家成立的日子。</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]It is not known when humans first settled on the Japanese archipelago, but the Jomon people might be called proto-Japanese, and they were spread throughout the archipelago by 250 BC. The Yayoi culture that arose in Kyushu, while the Jomon culture was still evolving, spread gradually eastward, overwhelming the Jomon. Culturally, the Yayoi represented a notable advance and flourished for some five or six centuries, from the 3rd century BC to the 3rd century AD. The unification of Japan under the Yamato court, with the tenno ("Emperor of Heaven") at its center, occurred around the mid-4th century. The 6th century reign of Kentai (507-531 AD) represented a decline of Yamato influence both at home and abroad; the period can be characterized by the growing accumulation of power by regional leaders and a weakening of royal influence.[PARAGRAPH:2]It was during this Yamato period that Japan first began to experience significant contact with the mainland. Buddhism was introduced to Japan by Korean monks around 530 and was shortly adopted by the emperor's court. Rather than displacing Japan's native Shinto religion, Buddhism would eventually merge with it to form the synthesis that characterizes modern Shintoism. Chinese influences were also particularly strong in Japan at this time; Prince Shotoku is said to have written the Constitution of Seventeen Articles promoting moral and political principles of the Chinese court. In the year 710, the first permanent Japanese capital was established in Nara, a city modeled after the Chinese capital. Buddhist monasteries near Nara became so influential that the court was moved to Kyoto in 794, which would remain the capital for the next thousand years.[PARAGRAPH:2]This Heian Period (794-1185) was characterized by a slow decline of Chinese influence in favor of the development of native Japanese customs. In the late Heian period, the more powerful of the Samurai gathered in or near the capital, where they served both the military needs of the emperor and also as bodyguards for the great noble houses. Emerging from provincial warrior bands, the aristocratic Samurai caste of the Kamakura period (1192-1333), with their military skills and deep pride in their stoicism, developed a disciplined culture distinct from the earlier, quiet refinement of the imperial court.[PARAGRAPH:2]Under the growing influence of Zen Buddhism during the Muromachi period (1338-1573), the samurai culture produced many uniquely Japanese arts that continue today. Although Japan was nominally united under the emperor and the shogun in Kyoto, the reality was that by the end of the Muromachi period the power of the government in Kyoto had declined to practically nothing. Japan disintegrated into a hodgepodge of warring feudal states, each presided over by a daimyo, or feudal lord. Many of the most famous stories of the samurai date from this "Sengoku" Period. Eventually, Japan was reunited through the efforts of three men: Oda Nobunaga, his general Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Hideyoshi's successor Tokugawa Ieyasu. Tokugawa founded the Edo shogunate (1603-1867), which ended the incessant conflicts and brought reform and peace to the islands. The following two and half centuries of peace brought prosperity to Japan, but the isolationist policy of the shoguns left the nation backwards technologically.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although small numbers of Spanish and Portuguese traders had been in Japan since the mid-1500s, it was the arrival of a squadron of U.S. warships commanded by Commodore Matthew C. Perry in Uraga Bay in July 1853 that finally opened the nation to Western influence. The opening up of Japan brought pressure for political reforms and a national identity that the oudated shogunate was unable to meet, leading to a revolution in the 1860s. The Meiji government that followed the overthrow of the shogunate set about the task of westernization and the creation of a modern state, and moved Japan onto the world stage. Japan's stunning victories over China (1894-95) and Russia (1904-05) announced its presence as a world power, but the same nationalistic forces that led to Japan's resurgence also caused xenophobia and violent excesses against non-Japanese peoples. Japanese aggression in the 1930s and 1940s resulted in invasions of China, Vietnam, Indonesia, and eventually the bombing of Pearl Harbor. After initial successes in World War II, the summer of 1945 brought disaster for the Japanese: the Americans took Okinawa in a bloody invasion, in August the Soviet Union declared war and swept over Manchuria, and atomic bombs largely destroyed the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, respectively. The Pacific War came to an end on August 14, with the formal surrender signed on September 2 in Tokyo Bay aboard the battleship USS Missouri. With postwar American aid, from 1952 to 1973 Japan experienced accelerated economic growth and social change. By the 1990s, Japan was again a first-class power, the senior partner in the emerging Asian economic bloc.</English>

		<Chinese>虽然无法确定自何时起在日本列岛上开始有人类居住，不过据信日本人的前身可能是绳纹人，且在公元前250年时已散居于日本各地。在绳纹文化继续发展的同时，弥生文化又在九洲兴起并逐渐向东扩张，驱走了绳纹人。相对而言，弥生文化具有明显的优势，其繁荣持续了五六个世纪之久，即公元前3世纪到公元后3世纪。到4世纪中期，大和朝廷统一了日本，建立了以“天皇”为中心的政权。到公元6世纪继体天皇统治时期（507-531），大和朝廷的影响力开始不断下降。这一时期的基本特点是地方豪族势力的逐渐壮大，以及皇族势力的日益衰落。[PARAGRAPH:2]在大和朝廷时期，日本与亚洲大陆的联系不断加强。佛教于公元530年左右由朝鲜僧侣传入日本并被天皇的宫廷所接受。但佛教并没有彻底取代本土的神道信仰，而是与其相互融合，最终形成了现在的神道教。这一时代中国文化对日本的影响也非常巨大，圣德太子在604年颁布的十七条宪法就是中国儒家政治和文化思想的体现。710年建城的日本第一座永久性都城——奈良（平城京）也完全模仿了中国都城长安的布局。奈良近郊的佛教寺院极度兴盛，以至皇室最终于794年迁居京都（平安京），该城在此后的一千年间一直都是日本的首都。[PARAGRAPH:2]在平安时代（794-1185），中国文化对日本的影响逐渐减弱，独特的本土文化开始发展。到平安时代晚期，集中于畿内或近畿地区的武士阶层势力大增，日本武士既为天皇作战，又担任贵族门阀的护卫。最初来自地方军队的武士到鐮仓时代（1192-1333）已发展为贵族化的特权阶层，他们崇尚勇武、坚忍与自信，逐渐形成了一种更为严苛的新文化体系，与先前精致纤巧的宫廷风尚形成鲜明对比。[PARAGRAPH:2]到了室町时代（1338-1573），佛教禅宗的影响日益增强，从武士文化中派生出许多日本独有的艺术形式并流传至今。到室町时代末期，虽然日本在名义上仍是由天皇和将军所统治的统一国家，但在实际上，京都政府的力量已经极度衰落。整个日本分裂为许多彼此争斗的大小封建政权，这些封建领主即所谓“大名”。在这个“战国”时代中，涌现出了许多著名的武士，他们的英雄事迹流传至今。最终日本在三个人的努力之下重新归于统一：织田信长、他的部将丰臣秀吉，以及继秀吉之后掌权的德川家康。德川家康创立了江户幕府（1603-1867），使日本列岛结束战乱恢复和平。此后的两个半世纪里日本的经济文化持续繁荣，但幕府政权执行的闭关锁国政策使这个国家在科技方面日益落后。[PARAGRAPH:2]虽然西班牙和葡萄牙商人与传教士在16世纪中叶已到达日本，但是直到1853年7月美国海军上将马修·佩里率领的舰队驶抵浦贺湾，才最终迫使这个国家向西方敞开大门。日本的对外开放推动了政治改革的进程和民族认同感的形成，守旧的幕府政权则越来越不合时宜，最终导致19世纪20年代倒幕运动的爆发。推翻幕府之后成立的明治政府开始执行西方化政策，努力建设一个现代化国家，并使日本开始登上世界舞台。日本在中日甲午战争（1894-1895）和日俄战争（1904-1905）中的胜利震惊了世界，也使日本成为世界列强的一员，但推动日本崛起的民族主义思想也导致了日本人仇外情绪和侵略兽性的高涨。在20世纪30和40年代，日本先后入侵中国、越南、印度尼西亚，并最终导致了偷袭珍珠港事件。虽然在二战初期取得了一连串胜利，但到1945年夏天，日本已面临穷途末路：美国经过血战占领冲绳，苏联也于八月向日本宣战并横扫满洲地区，8月6日和9日，两枚原子弹分别摧毁了广岛和长崎。8月14日，天皇终于宣布投降，太平洋战争结束，正式投降文书于9月2日在停靠东京湾的美国密苏里号战列舰上签署。战后的日本又获得了美国的帮助，从1952至1973年，日本经历了经济的加速成长和社会的巨大变革。到20世纪90年代，日本已重新成为一流强国以及新兴的亚洲经济带的重要参与者。</Chinese>

For instance, two pounds of matter, if converted completely into energy, would produce energy equivalent to the explosive force of 22 megatons of high explosives. In 1939, based on German experiments that successfully split the uranium atom, physicists were able to explain the process of nuclear fission.  When a large, unstable atomic nucleus splits (fissions) it results in two or more smaller, more stable nuclei accompanied by the release of tremendous amounts of energy and lingering, deadly radioactivity.[PARAGRAPH:2]The first application of this powerful technology was in warfare. A top-secret research effort in the U.S. known as the Manhattan Project studied the fission process, and eventually produced the first atomic bombs, which were dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. These relatively small bombs, the only atomic weapons ever used in a war, each produced an explosion equivalent to more than 20,000 tons of TNT. The nuclear weapons of today are capable of producing explosions thousands of times more powerful.</English>

Observing the oppressive social conditions besetting China, Mao became one of the original members of the Chinese Communist Party, where he worked to recruit peasants to the new party. The party was then engaged in a running guerilla war with Chaing Kai-shek, ruler of "Nationalist" China.[PARAGRAPH:2]Now a commander of one of the People's armies, Mao found himself in danger of encirclement and destruction. He famously led his ragtag force of 90,000 men, women and children on the grueling "Long March," a 6,000 mile trek through some of the most unpleasant terrain China has to offer. He arrived at the city of Yan'an having lost more than half of his force, but emerging as the undisputed leader of the Chinese Communist party.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-45), Mao fought both the Chinese Nationalist forces and the Japanese until the United States forced Japan's surrender in 1945.

This piece of political thinking resulted in the deaths of approximately twenty million Chinese, and easily set back China's development by 30 years. Not yet satisfied, in 1966 Mao and his wife initiated the "Cultural Revolution," a ten-year period in which China's artists, intellectuals, moderate politicians and other unenlightened or unlucky folk were imprisoned and killed or sent out to work the fields until they died or were judged "reeducated" by the workers. This adventure in social engineering killed perhaps one million people and further delayed China's emergence as a great world power.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mao died in 1976, beloved by his people. To summarize him as a man, it could be said that Mao was a great war leader, an exceptional political infighter, and an unbelievably brutal dictator.</English>

Crippled by polio at 39, Roosevelt displayed indomitable courage and resolve to overcome his disability and achieve his goals.[PARAGRAPH:2]Roosevelt was a man of contradictions. Though wealthy and powerful, Roosevelt was beloved by the poor and downtrodden and despised as a socialist by the wealthy and powerful. Roosevelt ran for office on a platform of isolationism, but he hated fascism and oppression, and unceasingly worked behind the scenes to aid the UK and get America into World War II.[PARAGRAPH:2]When Roosevelt first became President in 1932, the United States was in a crippling depression. Banks had closed and businesses had failed. Millions were unemployed and falling into poverty. To counter this malaise, Roosevelt enacted a series of policies that he called the "New Deal:" a sweeping program to bring recovery to business and agriculture, relief to the unemployed and to those in danger of losing businesses, farms and homes.[PARAGRAPH:2]Meanwhile, the Depression raged across the entire planet, and much of the rest of the world was degenerating into chaos. Japan was attacking China, while the two great dictators - Hitler and Stalin - were threatening to engulf Europe. The United States had largely withdrawn from world politics after World War I and the failure of the League of Nations, and few American politicians had the stomach to call for intervention. Roosevelt didn't, either, and in fact he ran for reelection on a platform of isolationism.[PARAGRAPH:2]However, Roosevelt sincerely believed that the United States would have to become involved in the conflict one way or another - he abhorred fascism and totalitarianism - and he feared that, left unchecked, Germany, Russia and Japan would become powerful enough to overwhelm everything in their path - including, eventually, the US. Thus he did everything in his power to ready the US for the upcoming conflict by dramatically increasing the size of the US armed forces, pitifully weakened after the end of World War I. Further, he gave as much aid as was politically feasible to England, whom he rightly saw as the unprepared US's chief protection from the German war machine. Meanwhile, he did his best to turn public opinion around in favor of more direct action.[PARAGRAPH:2]It is not clear that Roosevelt would have succeeded in that, if it weren't for Japan's attack against Pearl Harbor. Though casualties were extremely heavy, Pearl Harbor did "awake a sleeping giant," and at long last the citizens of the country realized their peril. And when Germany made the huge strategic blunder of declaring war on the United States shortly thereafter, Roosevelt was able to put all of the United States' massive industrial and military might into the conflict.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the war, Roosevelt showed himself to be a masterful international politician; the UK-Soviet-American alliance was shaky at best, and his adroit handling of Stalin and Churchill did much to keep things running (relatively) smoothly. Meanwhile his "fireside chats" kept the country firmly behind him, and world opinion in the allies' favor. It has been said that Hitler hated Roosevelt even more than Stalin or Churchill - high praise indeed.[PARAGRAPH:2]As a military leader Roosevelt was less sure-footed and the US made some early strategic blunders that could have been avoided. He learned quickly, however, and by the end of his life the US military machine was the most powerful that the world had ever seen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Roosevelt died in 1945, shortly before the war ended. His legacies of social welfare and international cooperation would dominate United States policies for the next half a century.</English>

While the Italian city-states produced the first transferable government bonds, they did not develop the other ingredient necessary to produce a fully fledged capital market: the stock market. In the early 1600s the Dutch East India Company (VOC) became the first company in history to issue bonds and shares of stock to the general public. As Edward Stringham (2015) notes, "companies with transferable shares date back to classical Rome, but these were usually not enduring endeavors and no considerable secondary market existed (Neal, 1997, p. 61)." The Dutch East India Company (founded in the year of 1602) was also the first joint-stock company to get a fixed capital stock and as a result, continuous trade in company stock occurred on the Amsterdam Exchange. Soon thereafter, a lively trade in various derivatives, among which options and repos, emerged on the Amsterdam market. Dutch traders also pioneered short selling - a practice which was banned by the Dutch authorities as early as 1610. Amsterdam-based businessman Joseph de la Vega's Confusion de Confusiones (1688) was the earliest known book about stock trading and first book on the inner workings of the stock market (including the stock exchange).</English>

It opened on April 4, 1973, and was destroyed in 2001 during the September 11 attacks. At the time of their completion, the Twin Towers - the original 1 World Trade Center, at 1,368 feet (417 m); and 2 World Trade Center, at 1,362 feet (415.1 m)-were the tallest buildings in the world. Other buildings in the complex included the Marriott World Trade Center (3 WTC), 4 WTC, 5 WTC, 6 WTC, and 7 WTC. The complex was located in New York City's Financial District and contained 13,400,000 square feet (1,240,000 m2) of office space.[PARAGRAPH:2]The core of the complex was built between 1975 and 1985, at a cost of $400 million (equivalent to $2.27 billion in 2018). During its existence, the World Trade Center experienced several major incidents, including a fire on February 13, 1975, a bombing on February 26, 1993, and a bank robbery on January 14, 1998. In 1998, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey decided to privatize it by leasing the buildings to a private company to manage. It awarded the lease to Silverstein Properties in July 2001.[PARAGRAPH:2]On the morning of September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda-affiliated hijackers flew two Boeing 767 jets into the North and South Towers within minutes of each other; two hours later, both towers collapsed. The attacks killed 2,606 people in and within the vicinity of the towers, as well as all 157 on board the two aircraft. Falling debris from the towers, combined with fires that the debris initiated in several surrounding buildings, led to the partial or complete collapse of all the buildings in the complex, and caused catastrophic damage to ten other large structures in the surrounding area.[PARAGRAPH:2]The cleanup and recovery process at the World Trade Center site took eight months, during which the remains of the other buildings were demolished. A new World Trade Center complex is being built with six new skyscrapers; some are already completed. A memorial and museum to those killed in the attacks, a new rapid transit hub, and an elevated park have been opened. One World Trade Center, the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere at 1,776 feet (541 m), is the lead building for the new complex, and was completed in November 2014.[PARAGRAPH:2]During its existence, the World Trade Center was one of the major icons of New York City. It had a major role in popular culture and according to one estimate was depicted in 472 films. Following the World Trade Center's destruction, mentions of the complex were altered or deleted, and several dozen "memorial films" were created.</English>

The rifle was a better weapon than its ancestors, with much more accuracy over a greater range than the musket and a much higher rate of fire.[PARAGRAPH:1]Riflemen were first employed in large numbers during the American Civil War. The rifle gave a strong defensive advantage, since riflemen could fire several times while the attackers advanced to within hand-to-hand distance. This was normally enough to hold any position.

		<English>[TAB]The Mole Antonelliana is a major landmark of the Italian city Turin. It is named for the architect who built it, Alessandro Antonelli. Construction began in 1863.[PARAGRAPH:2]Originally, it was intended to be a Jewish synagogue, as religious freedom had just been granted to non-Catholic groups, but the relationship between Antonelli and the Jewish community was not a happy one. He immediately began to propose a series of modifications which raised the final height to 113 meters-over 47 meters higher than the dome in the original design. Such changes, in addition to greater costs and construction time than were originally anticipated, did not please the Jewish community and construction was halted in 1869 with a provisional roof. In 1873 an exchange with the city of Turin for other land for a synagogue took place, and the Mole was dedicated to Victor Emanuel II. Antonelli again began construction, which took the height to 146, 153, and finally 167 meters (548 feet).[PARAGRAPH:2]Since 2000, the building houses Museo Nazionale del Cinema, the National Museum of Film. The Mole appears on the reverse of the two cent Italian euro coins and was the official emblem of the 2006 Winter Olympics. It is also the official emblem of the 2005 World Bocce Championships and the 2006 World Fencing Championships.[PARAGRAPH:2]On one side of the four-faced dome, the first Fibonacci numbers are written with red neon lights: they are part of the artistic work Il volo dei Numeri ("Flight of the numbers") by Mario Merz.</English>

The mosque contains the Kaaba, an ancient cube-shaped building which is said to have been built by the Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) and his son, Ishmael, at the orders of Allah, and which is believed to be the holiest place on Earth. The Kaaba in turn houses the "Black Stone," which it is said has fallen from heaven and has the power to cleanse worshippers of their sins.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Kaaba has always been revered as a holy place. Before the rise of Islam, the Kaaba was filled with idols, and Arabs from miles around came to worship there. Upon his return from exile, the Prophet Muhammad smashed the idols and rededicated the mosque to Allah and Islam. It has remained an Islamic holy place ever since and non-Muslims are forbidden to enter Mecca.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Masjid al-Haram is the focal point of the "hajj," a religious pilgrimage to Mecca required of all able-bodied Muslims (at least according to the Sunni sect). Every year during the holy month of Dhu'l-Hijjah, upwards of three million people visit the holy city and the most holy mosque within, thus fulfilling one of the "five pillars of Islam." The mosque has been enlarged and modernized to handle the extraordinary influx of faithful, but both the city and the mosque can barely handle the traffic.[PARAGRAPH:1]The mosque is in the form of a huge sprawling building surrounding a mighty courtyard with the Kaaba in the center. The building is extraordinarily beautiful and constructed of marble and porcelain and gold and bedecked with graceful minarets (towers). The interior is a wonder of columned halls filled with tapestries and other marvelous decorations. The courtyard itself is paved with marble. Truly a magnificent place of worship, Masjid al-Haram is said by some to surpass the Taj Mahal in glory and wonder.</English>

The Atomium depicts nine iron atoms in the shape of the body-centred cubic unit cell of an iron crystal, magnified 165 billion times.[PARAGRAPH:2]The construction of the Atomium was a technical feat. Of the nine spheres, six are accessible to the public, each with two main floors and a lower floor reserved for service. The central tube contains the fastest elevator of the time at 5 m/s (20 ft/s), installed by the Belgian branch of the Swiss firm Schlieren (subsequently taken over by Schindler). It allows 22 people to reach the summit in 23 seconds. The escalators installed in the oblique tubes are among the longest in Europe. The biggest is 35 m (100 ft) long.[PARAGRAPH:2]Three of the four top spheres lack vertical support and hence are not open to the public for safety reasons, although the sphere at the pinnacle is open to the public. The original design called for no supports; the structure was simply to rest on the spheres. Wind tunnel tests proved that the structure would have toppled in an 80 km/h (50 mph) wind (140 km/h (90 mph) winds have been recorded in Belgium). Support columns were added to achieve enough resistance against overturning.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Atomium, designed to last six months, was not destined to survive the 1958 World's Fair, but its popularity and success made it a major element of the Brussels landscape. Its destruction was therefore postponed year after year, until the city's authorities decided to keep it. However, for thirty years, little maintenance work was done.</English>

Brilliant stained glass windows shine gently down on the main altar, which contains a beautiful statue of the Virgin Mary, the cathedral's patron, holding the body of Jesus.[PARAGRAPH:1]The cathedral has suffered many periods of neglect over the years. During the French Revolution, many of Notre Dame's treasures were stolen and the building was used as a warehouse. In the early 1800s, the cathedral was in such a state of disrepair that the city planners contemplated tearing it down.

		<English>[TAB]La Mezquita (Spanish for "The Mosque") of C&#243;rdoba or Cordova is a Roman Catholic cathedral originally built as a mosque in the Andalusian city of C&#243;rdoba, Spain. It is regarded as perhaps the most accomplished monument of the Umayyad dynasty of C&#243;rdoba. After the Spanish Reconquista, it was turned into a church, with a Gothic cathedral inserted into the center of the large Moorish building. Today the entire building is used to house the Cathedral of the diocese of C&#243;rdoba in Spain.[PARAGRAPH:1]The building was begun in approximately 600 A.D. as the Christian Visigothic church of St. Vincent. The first Muslim Emir Abd ar-Rahman I bought the church and reworked it over two centuries to refashion it as a mosque, starting in 784 A.D. Additionally, Abd ar-Rahman I used the mosque (originally called Aljama Mosque) as an adjunct to his palace and named it to honor his wife. According to some authors the church of St. Vincent was demolished after it was bought from the local Christian community.[PARAGRAPH:1]Several explanations have been proposed to explain the mosque's unorthodox orientation. Some have suggested the mihrab faces south because the foundations of the mosque were taken from the old Roman and Visigoth constructions. Others contend that Abd ar-Rahman oriented the mihrab southward as if he were still in the Ummayyad capital of Damascus and not in exile.[PARAGRAPH:1]The mosque underwent numerous subsequent changes: Abd ar-Rahman III ordered a new minaret; Al-Hakam II, in 961, enlarged the building and enriched the mihrab. The last of the reforms was carried out by Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir in 987.[PARAGRAPH:1]It was the most magnificent of the more than 1,000 mosques in the city and was at one time the second largest mosque in the Muslim world. It was connected to the Caliph's palace by a raised walk-way, mosques within the palaces being the tradition for the Islamic rulers of all times.[PARAGRAPH:1]The city in which it was built was subject to frequent invasion and each conquering wave added their own mark to the architecture. The building is most notable for its giant arches, with over 1,000 columns of jasper, onyx, marble, and granite. These were made from pieces of the Roman temple which had occupied the site previously, as well as other destroyed Roman buildings. The double arches, pictured above, were a new introduction to architecture, and helped support the tremendous weight of the higher ceilings. The double arches consist of a lower horseshoe arch and an upper semi-circular arch. The Mezquita also features richly gilded prayer niches. A centrally located honey-combed dome has beautiful blue tiles decorated with stars. The mihrab is a masterpiece of architectural art, with geometric and flowing designs of plants. La Mezquita reached its current dimensions in 987 A.D. with the completion of the outer naves and orange tree courtyard.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 1236, C&#243;rdoba was recaptured from the Muslim army by King Ferdinand III of Castile and the mosque was reconsecrated as a Christian church. Alfonso X oversaw the construction of the Villaviciosa Chapel and the Royal Chapel within the mosque. The kings who followed added further Christian features: Enrique II rebuilt the chapel in the 14th century.[PARAGRAPH:1]The most significant alteration was building a Renaissance cathedral nave in the middle of the structure. It was constructed by permission of Charles V, king of united Spain. Its reversion to a Christian church (officially the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Virgin) may have helped to preserve it when the Spanish Inquisition was most active.[PARAGRAPH:1]Artisans and architects continued to add to the existing structure until the late 18th century.</English>

Encompassing much of what is today modern Thailand, Laos and Cambodia, the Khmer Empire had been wracked with internal feuding and chaos for fifty years before Suryavarman's reign. Born in the last quarter of the eleventh century, Suryavarman would grow to become a skilled general, statesman and patron of the arts.[PARAGRAPH:2]After overcoming his rivals for the throne, Suryavarman began a series of successful invasions into neighboring states and occupied what is now Thailand and Myanmar, extending the borders of the previously stagnant Khmer kingdom. Through his efforts, the empire re-established contact with China to the north and formed a powerful alliance with Champa to the east. Together with his Champa allies, Suryavarman launched an attack against the neighboring state of Dai Viet. Yet when their continued campaigns against Dai Viet ended in loss, the Champa King broke with the Khmer empire. Not one to lightly accept treachery, Suryavarman invaded neighboring Champa, but the brutal campaign ultimately cost the Khmer leader his life.[PARAGRAPH:2] Yet Suryavarman's impressive legacy would reach far beyond his territorial gains. The massive temple to Vishnu which was constructed under his reign - Angkor Wat - remains the largest religious structure in the world. Considered the epitome of Khmer architecture, Angkor Wat acted as the heart of Suryavarman's expanded kingdom. And while stunning as a work of art, Angkor Wat also served as a masterful propaganda piece for the lord of the Khmer. Numerous bas-reliefs of the ruler cover the temple. Many of the sculptures depict Suryavarman among his court or in combat, but above all, they portray him as a calm and talented ruler.

		<English>[TAB]A priest is a person authorized to perform the sacred rituals of a religion, especially as a mediatory agent between humans and one or more deities. They also have the authority or power to administer religious rites; in particular, rites of sacrifice to, and propitiation of, a deity or deities. Their office or position is the priesthood, a term which also may apply to such persons collectively.[PARAGRAPH:1]Priests have existed since the earliest of times and in the simplest societies, most likely as a result of agricultural surplus and consequent social stratification. The necessity to read sacred texts and keep temple or church records helped foster literacy in many early societies. Priests exist in many religions today, such as all or some branches of Judaism, Christianity, Shintoism, Hinduism. They are generally regarded as having positive contact with the deity or deities of the religion to which they subscribe, often interpreting the meaning of events and performing the rituals of the religion. There is no common definition of the duties of priesthood between faiths; but generally it includes mediating the relationship between one's congregation, worshippers, and other members of the religious body, and its deity or deities, and administering religious rituals and rites. These often include blessing worshipers with prayers of joy at marriages, after a birth, and at consecrations, teaching the wisdom and dogma of the faith at any regular worship service, and mediating and easing the experience of grief and death at funerals - maintaining a spiritual connection to the afterlife in faiths where such a concept exists. Administering religious building grounds and office affairs and papers, including any religious library or collection of sacred texts, is also commonly a responsibility - for example, the modern term for clerical duties in a secular office refers originally to the duties of a cleric. The question of which religions have a "priest" depends on how the titles of leaders are used or translated into English. In some cases, leaders are more like those that other believers will often turn for advice on spiritual matters, and less of a "person authorized to perform the sacred rituals" For example, clergy in Roman Catholicism and Orthodox Christianity are priests, but in Protestant Christianity they are typically minister and pastor. The terms priest and priestess are sufficiently generic that they may be used in an anthropological sense to describe the religious mediators of an unknown or otherwise unspecified religion.[PARAGRAPH:1]In many religions, being a priest or priestess is a full-time position, ruling out any other career. Many Christian priests and pastors choose or are mandated to dedicate themselves to their churches and receive their living directly from their churches. In other cases it is a part-time role. For example in the early history of Iceland the chieftains were titled go&#240;i, a word meaning "priest". As seen in the saga of Hrafnkell Freysgo&#240;i, however, being a priest consisted merely of offering periodic sacrifices to the Norse gods and goddesses; it was not a full-time role, nor did it involve ordination.[PARAGRAPH:1]In some religions, being a priest or priestess is by human election or human choice. In Judaism the priesthood is inherited in familial lines.</English>

During his reign, Tyre grew from a satellite of Sidon into the most important of Phoenician cities, and the holder of a large trading empire.  Hiram allied himself with king Solomon of Israel, the upcoming power of the region; together they would fill the power gap left by the retreat of Egypt when Assyria and Damascus were unable to do so.  Through the alliance with Solomon, Hiram ensured himself access to the major trade routes to Egypt, Arabia and Mesopotamia.  The two kings also joined forces in starting a trade route over the Red Sea, connecting the Israelite harbor of Ezion-Geber with a land called Ophir.  Both kings grew rich through this trade. Hiram sent Solomon architects, workmen and cedar wood to build the First Temple in Jerusalem.

In modern Mexico the name is applied to members of a part-time rural defense corps.[PARAGRAPH:1]The image of the Rurales as a ruthless and efficient organisation, which seldom took prisoners under the notorious ley fuga and inevitably got its man, was deliberately fostered under the Porfirian regime. However, research during the 1970s involving detailed examination of the records of the corps indicated that the Rurales were neither as effective nor as brutal as regime publicists had suggested. Never numbering more than about 4,000 men located in small detachments, the Rurales were too thinly spread to ever completely eliminate unrest in the Mexican countryside. They did however impose a superficial order, especially in the central regions around Mexico City, which encouraged the foreign investment sought by D&#237;az and his cient&#237;fico advisers . To a certain extent the regime saw the Rurales as a counterweight to the much larger Federal army and in the later years of the regime they were increasingly used to control industrial unrest, in addition to their traditional task of patrolling country areas.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The estuaries of the rivers Rhine, Meuse and Scheldt have been subject to flooding over the centuries. After building the Afsluitdijk (1927 - 1932), the Dutch started studying the damming of the Rhine-Meuse Delta. Plans were developed to shorten the coastline and turn the delta into a group of freshwater coastal lakes. By shortening the coastline, fewer dikes would have to be reinforced.[PARAGRAPH:2]Due to indecision and the Second World War, little action was taken. In 1950 two small estuary mouths, the Brielse Gat near Brielle and the Botlek near Vlaardingen were dammed. After the North Sea flood of 1953, a Delta Works Commission was installed to research the causes and develop measures to prevent such disasters in future. They revised some of the old plans and came up with the "Deltaplan".[PARAGRAPH:2]Unlike the Zuiderzee Works, the Delta Plan's purpose is largely defensive and not for land reclamation. The Delta Plan is a national programme and demands collaboration between the national government, provincial authorities, municipal authorities and the water boards. The plan consisted of blocking the estuary mouths of the Oosterschelde, the Haringvliet and the Grevelingen. This reduced the length of the dikes exposed to the sea by 700 kilometres (430 mi). The mouths of the Nieuwe Waterweg and the Westerschelde were to remain open because of the important shipping routes to the ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp. The dikes along these waterways were to be heightened and strengthened. The works would be combined with road and waterway infrastructure to stimulate the economy of the province of Zeeland and improve the connection between the ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp.</English>

Endowed with both beauty and intelligence, she became strong friends (if not more) with the great thinkers of the day, including the brilliant French philosophers Rousseau and Diderot.[PARAGRAPH:2]Catherine did not lack political ambition, however. At the age of 33, with the support of the Imperial guard, she overthrew her husband, the Emperor Peter III, who was soon killed "in a hunting accident," leaving Catherine the sole ruler of Russia. As Empress, Catherine pursued an expansionist policy, fighting two successful wars against the Ottoman Empire and acquiring vast territory in southern Ukraine and the Crimea. She undertook a wide range of political reforms, attempting to shape up the notoriously corrupt and incompetent Russian bureaucracy.

		<English>[TAB]In the mid-19th century, Brazil had been undergoing an economic transformation brought about by a new export crop: coffee. Coffee provided a new basis for agricultural expansion in southern Brazil. In the provinces of Rio de Janeiro and then S&#227;o Paulo, coffee estates, or fazendas, began to spread toward the interior as new lands were opened. By 1850, coffee made up more than 50% of Brazil's exports, and more than half of world coffee production.[PARAGRAPH:1]Along with the expansion of coffee growing came an intensification of slavery in Brazil, as the country's primary form of labor. More than 1.4 million Africans were forced to be slaves in Brazil in the last 50 years of the slave trade, and even after the trans-Atlantic slave trade ended, slavery continued until 1888.[PARAGRAPH:1]Because of the increased profit from the trade of coffee, the years after 1850 saw considerable growth and prosperity in Brazil.

He was the eldest son of Ashina Tuwu and chieftain of the T&#252;rks under the sovereignty of Rouran Khaganate. He is also mentioned as "Tumen" (commander of ten thousand) of the Rouran Khaganate.[PARAGRAPH:2]Not much is known about Bumin鈥檚 life except what was documented by Chinese chronicles. Accordingly, Bumin鈥檚 ascension began in 545, when his tribe was growing in strength and frequently invaded the western frontier of Wei. In response to that the chancellor of Western Wei, Yuwen Tai, sent a messenger to Tujue (Chinese name for the T&#252;rks seat in the Altai Mountains and/or its people) to greet Bumin and try to establish friendly relations. In 546, Bumin answered presenting tribute to Western Wei. In summer 551, the Tiele were launching an attack on Rouran, when Bumin鈥檚 army intercepted them and captured a large number of their people. After his victory, Bumin took advantage of this and requested a marriage with a daughter of Yujiul&#252; Anagui, Khagan of the Rouran. Anagui felt insulted and refused this request, viewing the T&#252;rks as inferior, sending to Bumin a messenger with his message: 鈥淵ou are my blacksmith slave. How dare you utter these words?鈥?(The T&#252;rks were indeed blacksmith servants for the Rouran elite and that may indicate a kind of vassalage system prevailed in Rouran society) In response, Bumin killed Anagui's messenger and cut off relations, leading a revolt against the Rouran.[PARAGRAPH:2]In addition to being a warrior leader, Bumin also used diplomacy as a tool against his enemies and to strengthen his position. After been denied the marriage with the Rouran princess and insulted, Bumin requested a Western Wei princess in marriage. Yuwen Tai, the chancellor of the state, seeking an alliance against the Rouran permitted it and sent Princess Changle to marry Bumin.  Other example is when Emperor Wen of Western Wei died, Bumin sent a messenger with two hundred horses in honor to his death, strengthening the relations with the Western Wei.[PARAGRAPH:2]The beginning of formal diplomatic relations with China propped up Bumin's authority among the Turks. He eventually united the local Turkic tribes and threw off the yoke of the Rouran domination. Allied with the Western Wei, Bumin defeated Anagui and his forces north of Huaihuang (modern Zhangjiakou, Hebei) in 552.[PARAGRAPH:2]Having excelled in both battle and diplomacy, Bumin declared himself Illig Khagan of the new khaganate at Otukan, but died within several months after his coronation. His younger brother and vassal Istemi in the western part and his son Issik Qaghan in the eastern part succeeded him. In less than one century, his khaganate expanded to comprise most of Central Asia.</English>

The tsar was responsible for other reforms, including reorganizing the judicial system, setting up elected local judges, abolishing corporal punishment, promoting local self-government through the zemstvo system, imposing universal military service, ending some privileges of the nobility, and promoting university education.[PARAGRAPH:2]In foreign policy, Alexander sold Alaska to the United States in 1867, fearing the remote colony would fall into British hands if there were another war. He sought peace, moved away from bellicose France when Napoleon III fell in 1871, and in 1872 joined with Germany and Austria in the League of the Three Emperors that stabilized the European situation. Despite his otherwise pacifist foreign policy, he fought a brief war with the Ottoman Empire in 1877-78, pursued further expansion into Siberia and the Caucasus, and conquered Turkestan. Although disappointed by the results of the Congress of Berlin in 1878, Alexander abided by that agreement. Among his greatest domestic challenges was an uprising in Poland in 1863, to which he responded by stripping that land of its separate constitution and incorporating it directly into Russia.

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_CIV_SWAHILI_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]The Swahili are unique Bantu inhabitants of the East African Coast mainly from Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique. They are mainly united by culture and under the mother tongue of Kiswahili, a Bantu language. This also extends to Arab, Persian, and other migrants who reached the coast some believe as early as the 7th-8th c. CE, and mixed with the local people there, providing considerable cultural infusion and numerous loan words from Arabic and Persian. Archaeologist, Felix Chami notes the presence of Bantu settlements straddling the East African coast as early as the beginning of the 1st millennium. They evolved gradually from the 6th century onward to accommodate for an increase in trade (mainly with Arab merchants), population growth, and further centralized urbanization; developing into what would later become known as the Swahili City-States. Some of the main Swahili city-states included Mombasa, Gede, Pate, Malindi, Zanzibar, and Kilwa. Many of these city-states were Muslim and very cosmopolitan. Each of these states were politically independent of each other. They all competed against one another for the best of the African trade business. The chief export of these cultures was ebony, gold, ivory, and sandalwood. For centuries the Swahili depended greatly on trade from the Indian Ocean. The Swahili have played a vital role as middle man between east, central and south Africa, and the outside world. Trade contacts have been noted as early as 100 A.D. by early Roman writers who visited the East African coast in the first century. Trade routes extended across Tanzania into modern day Zaire, along which goods were brought to the coasts and were sold to Arab, Indian, and Portuguese traders and even reached as far as China and India. Materials attributed to this network of trade were also found at Great Zimbabwe. During the apogee of the middle ages, ivory and slaves became a substantial source of revenue. Many slaves sold in Zanzibar ended up in Brazil, which was then a Portuguese colony. Swahili fishermen of today still rely on the ocean to supply their primary source of income. Fish is sold to their inland neighbors in exchange for products of the interior.[PARAGRAPH:2]Islam established its presence in the East African coast from around 1012 AD, when the traders from the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula continued to journey to these parts during monsoon seasons and to interact with the local people through trade, intermarriage, and an exchange of ideas. Because of this interaction, most of the Swahili today are Muslim. The unifying force of Islam consolidated into an amalgam of otherwise different ethnicities and provided an enduring common identity for many of the people in coastal East Africa. The Swahili follow a very strict and orthodox form of Islam. They believe in jinns and most men wear protective amulets around their necks, which contain verses from the Koran. Divination is practiced through Koranic readings. Often the diviner incorporates verses from the Qu'ran into treatments for certain diseases. On occasion, he instructs a patient to soak a piece of paper containing verses of the Qu'ran in water. With this ink infused water, literally containing the word of Allah, the patient will then wash his body or drink it to cure himself of his affliction. It is only prophets and teachers of Islam who are permitted to become medicine men among the Swahili.[PARAGRAPH:2]After Germany seized the region known as Tanganyika (present day mainland Tanzania) for a colony in 1886, it took notice of the wide (but shallow) dissemination of Swahili, and soon designated Swahili as a colony-wide official administrative language. The British did not do so in neighbouring Kenya, even though they made moves in that direction. The British and Germans both were keen to facilitate their rule over colonies with dozens of languages spoken by selecting a single local language that hopefully would be well accepted by the natives. Swahili was the only good candidate in these two colonies. In the aftermath of Germany's defeat in World War I, it was dispossessed of all its overseas territories. Tanganyika fell into British hands. The British authorities, with the collaboration of British Christian missionary institutions active in these colonies, increased their resolve to institute Swahili as a common language for primary education and low level governance throughout their East African colonies (Uganda, Tanganyika, Zanzibar, and Kenya). Swahili was to be subordinate to English: university education, much secondary education, and governance at the highest levels would be conducted in English.[PARAGRAPH:2]Today, even though the Swahili trade centers went obsolete hundreds of years ago, the Swahili culture is still a very big part of the African way of life. The aspects of the Swahili culture are diverse due to its many origins when it was first created. The usage of Swahili in other countries is commonly overstated, being common only in market towns, among returning refugees, or near the borders of Kenya and Tanzania. Even so, Swahili possibly exceeds Hausa of West Africa as the sub-Saharan indigenous language with the greatest number of speakers, and Swahili speakers may number some ten to fifteen percent of the 750 million people of sub-Saharan Africa.</English>

		<Chinese>斯瓦希里人是东非海岸独特的班图族居民，主要来自肯尼亚、坦桑尼亚和莫桑比克。他们主要由文化和斯瓦希里语（班图语）的母语联合在一起。这也适用于阿拉伯人、波斯人和其他移民，有些人认为他们早在公元前7-8年就到达了海岸，并在那里与当地人混在一起，提供了大量的文化灌输和大量阿拉伯语和波斯语的外来词。考古学家费利克斯·查米（Felix Chami）指出，早在公元1世纪初，就有横跨东非海岸的班图定居点。从6世纪开始，它们逐渐演变为适应贸易增长（主要是与阿拉伯商人的贸易）、人口增长和进一步的集中城市化；发展成为后来被称为斯瓦希里城邦的国家。一些主要的斯瓦希里城邦包括蒙巴萨、盖德、帕特、马林迪、桑给巴尔和基尔瓦。这些城邦中有许多是穆斯林和非常国际化的。这些州在政治上彼此独立。他们都互相竞争，争夺最好的非洲贸易业务。这些文化的主要出口是乌木、黄金、象牙和檀香木。几个世纪以来，斯瓦希里人很大程度上依赖于印度洋的贸易。斯瓦希里人在东部、中部和南非以及外部世界之间扮演着至关重要的角色。早在公元100年，早期罗马作家就注意到了贸易往来，他们在第一世纪访问了东非海岸。贸易路线横跨坦桑尼亚一直延伸到现代的扎伊尔，沿途货物被带到海岸，卖给阿拉伯、印度和葡萄牙商人，甚至到达中国和印度。在大津巴布韦也发现了这种贸易网络的材料。在中世纪的鼎盛时期，象牙和奴隶成为收入的重要来源。许多在桑给巴尔出售的奴隶最终来到了当时是葡萄牙殖民地的巴西。今天的斯瓦希里渔民仍然依靠海洋来提供他们的主要收入来源。鱼被卖给他们的内陆邻居，以换取内地的产品[段落：2]公元1012年左右，当波斯湾和阿拉伯半岛的商人在季风季节继续前往这些地区并通过贸易与当地人民交流时，伊斯兰教就在东非海岸建立了自己的存在，通婚，思想交流。由于这种互动，今天的斯瓦希里人大部分是穆斯林。伊斯兰教的统一力量融合成了不同种族的混合体，为东非沿海地区的许多人提供了一个持久的共同身份。斯瓦希里人遵循一种非常严格和正统的伊斯兰教形式。他们相信精灵，大多数男人脖子上都戴着护身符，上面有古兰经的经文。占卜是通过阅读古兰经来练习的。占卜者通常会将《古兰经》中的诗句融入某些疾病的治疗中。有时，他指导病人把一张写着《古兰经》诗句的纸泡在水里。用这种墨水灌注的水，字面上包含真主的话，病人将洗他的身体或喝它治愈自己的痛苦。只有先知和伊斯兰教教师才被允许成为斯瓦希里人中的医生。1886年，德国占领了坦噶尼喀地区（今坦桑尼亚大陆）作为殖民地后，德国注意到斯瓦希里语的广泛（但很浅）传播，并很快指定斯瓦希里语作为整个殖民地的官方行政语言。英国人并没有在邻国肯尼亚这样做，尽管他们朝着这个方向前进。英国人和德国人都热衷于通过选择一种当地语言，希望当地人能很好地接受他们的殖民地统治。斯瓦希里人是这两个殖民地唯一的好候选人。在第一次世界大战中，德国在海外的所有领土都被剥夺了。坦噶尼喀落入英国人手中。英国当局在活跃于这些殖民地的英国基督教传教士机构的合作下，更加决心将斯瓦希里语作为其整个东非殖民地（乌干达、坦噶尼喀、桑给巴尔和肯尼亚）的初级教育和低水平治理的共同语言。斯瓦希里语将从属于英语：大学教育、大部分中等教育和最高级别的治理都将用英语进行[段落：2]今天，尽管斯瓦希里人的贸易中心几百年前就已经过时了，但斯瓦希里文化仍然是非洲生活方式的重要组成部分。斯瓦希里文化的方方面面是多样的，因为它的起源是多方面的。斯瓦希里语在其他国家的使用通常被夸大了，只在集镇、返回的难民中或在肯尼亚和坦桑尼亚边界附近才普遍。即便如此，斯瓦希里语可能超过西非的豪萨语，成为撒哈拉以南土著语言中使用人数最多的一种，讲斯瓦希里语的人可能占撒哈拉以南非洲7.5亿人口的10%至15%。</Chinese>

It was in his Menlo Park laboratory that Thomas Edison invented the phonograph and developed a commercially viable incandescent light bulb filament. Christie Street in Menlo Park was one of the first streets in the world to use electric lights for illumination. Edison left Menlo Park and moved his home and laboratory to West Orange, New Jersey in 1887. After his death, the Thomas Alva Edison Memorial Tower and Museum was constructed near his old Menlo Park lab and dedicated in 1938. Edison's old lab site and memorial now make up Edison State Park.

		<English>[TAB]Israel, officially the State of Israel, is a country in the Middle East, bordering the Mediterranean Sea and a small strip of the Red Sea, and neighboring Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Egypt, and the Palestinan territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. With 8.8 million inhabitants as of 2018, including 75% of Jews, it is the world's only majority-Jewish state.[PARAGRAPH:2]The history of Israel has its origin in the Iron Age kingdoms of Israel and Judea, which starting in 720 BCE were controlled successively by many foreign powers, including the Neo-Assyrian, Neo-Babylonian and Persian Empires, the Hellenistic Kingdoms, the Roman (and then Byzantine) Empire, the Rashidun, Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates, the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt, the Ottoman Empire, and the United Kingdom. Starting in the 19th century, national awakening among the Jews of the diaspora led to the creation of the Zionist movement, which advocated immigration back to the land of Israel, from which they had been expelled in the 1st century AD. This led the United Nations to propose a plan to partition British Mandatory Palestine into two states, one for the Jews and one for the Arab Palestinians. While the Jews accepted the plan, the Arabs did not. Nevertheless, the State of Israel declared its independence on 14 May 1948. This was immediately followed by a war between Israel and several Arab countries, which Israel won, allowing it to expand its territory to most of the former Mandatory Palestine. In 1967, Israeli was also victorious in the Six-Day War, after which it occupied the Palestinian Territories. While Israel has since signed peace treaties with neighboring Egypt and Jordan, its relations with most Muslim-majority countries remain strained or non-existent due to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and contentious issues such as the status of the holy city of Jerusalem. As a result of its hostile geopolitical environment, Israel has important military capabilities and is suspected of having developed nuclear weapons.[PARAGRAPH:2]One of the objectives of the establishment of Israel was to create a safe haven for the Jewish people, who had been the victims of the Holocaust a few years prior. The Law of Return thus allows any Jew to settle in Israel and obtain citizenship, a process called in Hebrew 'Aliyah', meaning 'ascension'. As a result, the country has been shaped by immigration. This may have contributed to making Israel an economically advanced nation with a high rate of innovation and the largest number of high-tech start-ups per capita.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Calendars played an important role in the development of human culture. Their earliest uses may have been mystical - to chart the courses of the stars and to determine the most auspicious days upon which to perform religious sacrifices - but they were also critical for determining when the best time was to plant and harvest crops.[PARAGRAPH:2]All that is needed to create a calendar is careful observation and record-keeping. After watching the skies for a long time, one might notice that the days gradually get shorter and then longer, and that this process takes 365 days to repeat. This would give the length of a year - the great cycle of life on the planet. Further observations on the movement of the moon and stars would provide further details.[PARAGRAPH:2]Perhaps the most difficult aspect of creating an accurate calendar is that a year takes 365 and a quarter days rather than exactly 365. If one does not take this into account (say, by the inclusion of an extra day every four years as currently), over the years one's calendar will get more and more out of date with the natural world.[PARAGRAPH:2]The earliest known Egyptian calendar was created in 4000 BC. The earliest known Sumerian calendar was invented around 1000 years later, and the first Chinese one was invented around 1400 BC.

In 1544, the young Count of Nassau, but 11 years old, became the Prince of Orange through an inheritance, with new holdings in the Netherlands waiting for young Willem to come of age.[PARAGRAPH:2]Oranje was raised in the lap of luxury, his family a favorite of the Spanish monarch in control of the Netherlands, Charles V. Oranje received his education in France at the behest of the Spanish King and proved to be both a precocious student and a charismatic leader. With the completion of his education, Oranje took control of his estates in the Netherlands. Thanks in part to his calm demeanor, which was a welcome change during an age of rising tensions, Oranje was appointed to a number of important posts within the Dutch government, eventually reaching the position of stadtholder, the highest rank open to a Dutchman. His selection to this auspicious rank came thanks to Phillip II, Charles' son and the new King.[PARAGRAPH:2]By 1559, enforcement of the law of Placaten, which made Protestantism not only a religious crime, but a civil one as well, increased bloodshed between Protestants and Catholics throughout the Netherlands. Oranje, taking a stance against the persecution of Protestants in the Netherlands, gradually found himself on the wrong side of the Catholic Spanish monarchs. Catching word of an imminent assassination attempt, Oranje was forced to retreat to his castle in Nassau, hoping to keep himself alive and free of the growing Dutch rebellion.[PARAGRAPH:2]When Phillip II sent Fernando de Toledo, the Duke of Alva, to deal with the uprising and arrest its leaders, Oranje was included in the list of outlaws. After failing to defeat Alva with his meager army, Oranje again fled, fortifying himself in the states of Holland. The Prince of Oranje, universally recognized for his ability and cunning, now found himself embroiled in the heart of the sweeping Dutch rebellion, which would continue to grow in size and scope into what became known as the Eighty Years' War.[PARAGRAPH:2]Due to sudden changes in Spanish leadership within the region, a number of provinces, taking advantage of the ensuing havoc, allied themselves with Oranje and the rebellion. With the signing of the Union of Utrecht in 1579, the five northern provinces of the Netherlands, along with much of Flanders and Brabant, previously separate, united in their opposition to Spain.[PARAGRAPH:2]To support the insufficient Dutch forces, Oranje had sought foreign aid and in 1581 received word from Francis, Duke of Anjou, brother of the French king, that if the struggling provinces declared independence from Spain and appointed Francis their sovereign, he would aid them in defeating their Spanish foe. So, on July 26, 1581, the United Provinces declared their independence from Spain.[PARAGRAPH:2]Oranje, unfortunately, was unable to enjoy his country's new independence for long. Unhappy with the restrictions the Dutch nobles had placed on his powers, the Duke of Anjou turned against Oranje and his peers. And while Anjou was defeated not long after, an assassin hired by King Phillip gunned down Willem van Oranje in 1584, bringing to an end the leader's grand struggle for Dutch freedom.[PARAGRAPH:2]While Oranje had passed on, the want for an independent Netherlands did not.

		<English>[TAB]Egalitarianism (from French &#233;gal, meaning "equal") is a trend of thought that favors equality among living entities. Egalitarian doctrines maintain that all humans are equal in fundamental worth or social status, according to The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The Cultural theory of risk holds egalitarianism as defined by (1) a negative attitude towards rules and principles, and (2) a positive attitude towards group decision-making, with fatalism termed as its opposite. According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, the term has two distinct definitions in modern English. It is defined either as a political doctrine that all people should be treated as equals and have the same political, economic, social, and civil rights or as a social philosophy advocating the removal of economic inequalities among people or the decentralization of power. Some sources define egalitarianism as the point of view that equality reflects the natural state of humanity.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_UNIT_HEAVY_SPEARMAN_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]Broadly speaking, spears were either designed to be used in melee, or to be thrown. Within this simple classification, there was a remarkable range of types. For example, M.J. Swanton identified thirty different spearhead categories and sub-categories in Early Saxon England. Most medieval spearheads were generally leaf-shaped. Notable types of Early medieval spears include the angon, a throwing spear with a long head similar to the Roman pilum, used by the Franks and Anglo-Saxons, and the winged (or lugged) spear, which had two prominent wings at the base of the spearhead, either to prevent the spear penetrating too far into an enemy or to aid in spear fencing. Originally a Frankish weapon, the winged spear also was popular with the Vikings. It would become the ancestor of later medieval polearms, such as the partisan and spetum.[PARAGRAPH:2]The thrusting spear also has the advantage of reach, being considerably longer than other weapon types. Exact spear lengths are hard to deduce as few spear shafts survive archaeologically but 6鈥? ft (1.8鈥?.4 m) would seem to have been the norm. Some nations were noted for their long spears, including the Scots and the Flemish. Spears usually were used in tightly ordered formations, such as the shieldwall or the schiltron. To resist cavalry, spear shafts could be planted against the ground. William Wallace drew up his schiltrons in a circle at the Battle of Falkirk in 1298 to deter charging cavalry, it was a widespread tactic sometimes known as the "crown" formation.[PARAGRAPH:2]Throwing spears became rarer as the Middle Ages drew on, but survived in the hands of specialists such as the Catalan Almogavars. They were commonly used in Ireland until the end of the 16th century.[PARAGRAPH:2]Spears began to lose fashion among the infantry during the 14th century, being replaced by pole weapons that combined the thrusting properties of the spear with the cutting properties of the axe, such as the halberd. Where spears were retained they grew in length, eventually evolving into pikes, which would be a dominant infantry weapon in the 16th and 17th centuries.</English>

However, rocket launch sites for purely sub-orbital flights are sometimes called spaceports, as in recent years new and proposed sites for suborbital human flights have been frequently referred to or named 'spaceports'. Space stations and proposed future bases on the moon are sometimes called spaceports, in particular if intended as a base for further journeys.[PARAGRAPH:2]The term rocket launch site is used for any facility from which rockets are launched. It may contain one or more launch pads or suitable sites to mount a transportable launch pad. It is typically surrounded by a large safety area, often called a rocket range or missile range. The range includes the area over which launched rockets are expected to fly, and within which some components of the rockets may land. Tracking stations are sometimes located in the range to assess the progress of the launches.[PARAGRAPH:2]Major spaceports often include more than one launch complex, which can be rocket launch sites adapted for different types of launch vehicles.

		<English>[TAB]Over the centuries the Yarlung Zangbo valley was the focus of ancient trade routes from India, China, and central Asia. Tibet emerged from an obscure history to flourish in the 7th cent. AD as an independent kingdom with its capital at Lhasa. Toward the end of the 12th century many Indian Buddhists, fleeing before the Muslim invasion, went to Tibet. In the 13th century Tibet fell under Mongol influence, which was to last until the 18th century. In 1270, Kublai Khan, emperor of China, was converted to Buddhism by the abbot of the Sakya lamasery. The abbot returned to Tibet to found the Sakya dynasty (1270-1340) and to become the first priest-king of Tibet. In 1720, the Ch'ing dynasty replaced Mongol rule in Tibet. China thereafter claimed suzerainty, often merely nominal.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the 18th century, British authorities in India attempted to establish relations with Lhasa, but Tibet maintained its traditional seclusion. Meanwhile, Ladakh, long part of Tibet, was lost to the rulers of Kashmir, and Sikkim was seized by Britain. In 1906, Britain recognized China's suzerainty over Tibet. However, the Tibetans were able to expel the Chinese from Tibet and reassert their independence (1912). After the death (1933) of the 13th Dalai Lama, Tibet gradually drifted back into the Chinese orbit. By a Tibetan-Chinese agreement (May, 1951), Tibet became a national autonomous region of China under the traditional rule of the Dalai Lama, but under the actual control of a Chinese Communist Commission.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Communist government introduced far-reaching land reforms and sharply curtailed the power of the monastic orders. Full-scale revolt broke out in March, 1959. The Chinese suppressed the rebellion, but the Dalai Lama managed to escape to India.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Chinese adopted brutal repressive measures, provoking charges from the Dalai Lama of genocide. Landholdings were seized, the lamaseries were virtually emptied, and thousands of monks were forced to find other work. In 1965 the Tibetan Autonomous Region was formally established. The Cultural Revolution, with its antireligious orientation, was disastrous for highly religious Tibet. Religious practices were banned and over 4,000 monasteries were destroyed. Though the ban was lifted in 1976 and some Buddhist temples have again been in operation since the early 1980s, Tibetans continue to complain of widespread discrimination by the Chinese. Several protests in Tibet in the late 1980s and early 1990s were violently suppressed by the Communist government and martial law was imposed in 1989. Demonstrations against Chinese rule have nevertheless continued. Moreover, in recent years other countries have increasingly raised the issue of human-rights violations in Tibet, and have pressured the Chinese government to moderate their stance in that region.</English>

吐蕃社会生产以农牧业为主。农作物有青稞、小麦、荞麦等；牲畜有牦牛、马、驼、羊等；手工业有烧炭、冶铁、制胶、毛织等。吐蕃时期的碑铭、木简、文书、经卷等尚有大量保存至今，是研究吐蕃社会和历史的宝贵资料。吐蕃王朝崩溃后，宋朝、元朝和明朝初年的汉文史籍仍泛称青藏高原及当地人民为“吐蕃”或“西蕃”。</Chinese>

Rajendra formally ascended the Chola throne in 1014 AD, two years after his installation as the Co Regent. He placed a son on the throne at Madurai, completed the conquest of Ceylon, overran the Deccan (c. 1021), and sent (1023) an expedition to the north that penetrated to the Ganges River and brought Ganges water to the new capital, Gangaikondacolapuram.[PARAGRAPH:2]Before the fourteenth year of Rajendra's reign c. 1025, the Chola Navy crossed the ocean and attacked the Srivijaya kingdom of Sangrama Vijayatungavarman. Kadaram, the capital of the powerful maritime kingdom, was sacked and the king taken captive. Along with Kadaram, Pannai in present day Sumatra and Malaiyur in the Malayan peninsula were attacked. Kedah (now in modern Malaysia) too was occupied. There are no records to explain the nature of and the reason for this naval expedition. The Sailendra dynasty had been in good relations with the Chola Empire during the period of Rajaraja Chola I. Rajaraja encouraged Mara Vijayatungavarman to build the Chudamani Vihara at Nagapattinam. Rajendra confirmed this grant in the Anaimangalam grants showing that the relationship with Srivijaya was still continued be friendly. The exact cause of the quarrel that caused the naval war between Cholas and Srivijaya remains unknown.[PARAGRAPH:2]Rajendra's long reign saw almost continuous campaigns and conflicts trying to hold his huge empire together. Rajendra's sons carried out most of the campaigns during the late period of his reign. The emperor refrained from taking the field personally allowing his sons to win glory and distinction. The closing years of Rajendra forms the most splendid period of Cholas. The extent of the empire was the widest and the military and naval prestige was at its highest. The emperor was ably assisted by his sons and other members of his family. The Chola imperialism was a benevolent one attested by the presence of the traditional rulers in the Pandya and Kerala countries and the act of reinstating the Srivijaya king after his defeat.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Numidia was a Berber kingdom located in northern Africa to the west of Carthage. Originally nomadic tribesmen and well-versed in horsemanship, the Numidians were most famous for their cavalry, which was considered to be among the finest in the ancient world. These warriors were lightly-armed - riding on swift horses equipped with nothing more than a small shield and a fistful of javelins - but very tough customers nonetheless. Even after settling down in cities, the Numidians remained enamored with the horse warriors - the Numidians did eventually produce infantry, but it was always regarded as unreliable and substantially inferior to the cavalry.[PARAGRAPH:1]Numidian cavalry specialized in hit-and-run attacks, making excellent use of their javelins to harass and break up enemy formations. They were never intended to close with the enemy and fight hand-to-hand. Roman commanders were initially skeptical of the threat posed by such lightly armed cavalry, but they soon learned of the danger caused by a force that constantly would attack, retreat and regroup, and then attack again, always remaining out of range of melee weapons. Ancient authors compare the Numidian cavalry to a pack of dogs, because of the way that they savaged the flanks and rear of enemy formations. It required strict discipline for opposing infantry not to break ranks when they came under attack from Numidian cavalry, but in time the Romans learned from their mistakes and became more adept at combating them.[PARAGRAPH:1]Numidian cavalry was not the fastest, but since the riders wore no armor, they were nimbler than the opposition of the day and able to traverse terrain too difficult for heavier cavalry. Numidian cavalry is most famous for serving in Hannibal's cavalry wing during the Second Punic War. However, they were also employed by the Romans as mercenaries as well. Julius Caesar deployed Numidians during his campaigns - and also fought against them during the Roman Civil War. In short, Numidian cavalry was highly prized and among the best light cavalry in the ancient world.</English>

The inscription is dated 1088, indicating that there was an active overseas trade during the Chola period.[PARAGRAPH:1]Towards the end of the 9th century, southern India had developed extensive maritime and commercial activity, especially with the Chinese and Arabs. The Cholas, being in possession of parts of both the west and the east coasts of peninsular India, were at the forefront of these ventures. The Tang dynasty of China, the Srivijaya empire in the Malayan archipelago under the Sailendras, and the Abbasid Kalifat at Baghdad were the main trading partners.[PARAGRAPH:1]The trade with the Chinese was a very lucrative enterprise, and Trade guilds needed the king's approval and the license from the customs force/department to embark on overseas voyages for trade. The normal trade voyage of those day involved three legs of journey, starting with the Indian goods (mainly spices, cotton and gems) being shipped to China and in the return leg the Chinese goods (silk, incense,iron) were brought back to Chola ports. After some materials were utilized for local consumption, the remaining cargo along with Indian cargo was shipped to the Arabs. Traditionally, this involved transfer of material/cargo to many ships before the ultimate destination was reached.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The trebuchet was a medieval siege weapon designed to throw a projectile a great distance through the air. The trebuchet originated in China sometime between the fifth and third centuries BC. From there it spread to the west, reaching Europe around 500 AD.[PARAGRAPH:1]Although it is usually thought of as a type of catapult, the trebuchet is in fact a gigantic sling attached to a lever. The shorter arm of the lever carries a counterweight, while the longer arm carries the sling that throws the projectile. In operation the sling end is pulled towards the ground (lifting the counterweight in the process) and held in place by a trigger while a projectile is loaded into the sling. When the trigger is released, the counterweight falls and the sling flies up and above the machine, releasing the projectile at the top of its arc.[PARAGRAPH:1]Constructed properly, trebuchets could fire very heavy loads. In modern reconstructions using trebuchets built with the original tools and materials, trebuchets have been able to throw projectiles weighing as much as 300 kilograms. Aiming the trebuchet was difficult and required some practice and knowledge of engineering - both of which were usually in short supply for medieval operators. Trebuchets were also extremely heavy and almost immobile; this, combined with their slow rate of their fire, made them impractical for anything except siege operations.[PARAGRAPH:1]Although the Chinese were the first to develop the trebuchet, by the time of the Mongol invasions the Chinese had fallen behind other parts of the world in siege technology. This was due to the fact that China had been politically united for long periods of time, preventing the formation of strong fortresses across the country, and the traditional enemies of the Chinese were nomadic warriors - not fortified city-dwellers. Nevertheless, the Chinese were still far more advanced in siege warfare than the Mongols, and it was not until the Mongols adopted Chinese practices that they began to have success capturing enemy fortifications.[PARAGRAPH:1]Late in the conquest of Song China, Mongol leader Kublai Khan brought in Arab engineers from the Mongol holdings in Persia to build hinged counterweight trebuchets, which were more advanced than anything yet seen in China. With the aid of these powerful weapons, Kublai was able to take the previously-impenetrable fortress of Xiangyang in 1273, and from there rapidly take the rest of Song China's cities, completing his conquest of the Song Empire in 1279.</English>

Growing up an unwanted daughter of a insane father who was destroying England's ties to the Catholic Church and engaging in civil war so that he could legally marry another woman (several other women, in fact), Elizabeth had to use all of her wits to survive.[PARAGRAPH:2]Elizabeth received an excellent education at the hands of various tutors, including the great scholars of the day. She was an outstanding student, and could speak five languages fluently.[PARAGRAPH:2]When King Henry VIII died, the throne passed to his young son, Edward. At fifteen Elizabeth was implicated in a plot to overthrow him. She came close to being executed, surviving only because she was able to convince her skeptical interrogators that she knew nothing of the plot.[PARAGRAPH:2]When King Edward died in 1553, Elizabeth's older sister, Mary, assumed the throne. An ardent Catholic, Mary was quite unpopular with a number of Protestant noblemen, who attempted unsuccessfully to overthrow her in 1554. Once again Elizabeth was implicated, but once again she talked her way out of execution.[PARAGRAPH:2]Queen Mary died in 1558, and Elizabeth became Queen. Elizabeth was an extraordinary ruler. She established the Protestant Church as the official Church of England. However, she attempted to stem the persecution of Catholics in the country - at least as much as was possible when the Catholic nobility were actively plotting her demise. She restored the debased currency of England, and she made England a center of culture, where great artists like William Shakespeare flourished.[PARAGRAPH:2]Elizabeth used all of the tools available to her to achieve her goals. She received countless offers of marriage from nobility and indeed from kings across Europe. But she accepted none of them, instead using her unmarried state to control her friends and foes alike; if one faction got too strong, she could drive them back into line by suggesting that she was considering marrying someone from an opposing faction.[PARAGRAPH:2]Militarily, Catholic Spain was England's greatest threat. Spain was the great continental power of the day, and its leader, King Philip, had upon more than one occasion expressed the intent of invading England. In 1588 he tried, building a huge armada to conquer the upstart nation. Elizabeth quickly organized the country's navy to fend off the fleet, and by a combination of superior tactics, ship design, and some foul weather at just the right moment, they defeated the Spanish foe. England was not to be seriously threatened with invasion for about 400 years.[PARAGRAPH:2]Elizabeth died in 1603, having left her country in far better state.

		<English>[TAB]Carthage was an ancient city-state in North Africa located somewhere near the site of modern Tunis. It was settled by Phoenician colonists from the city of Tyre sometime around 814 BC. According to tradition, the first ruler was a queen named Dido, who is mentioned in a number of surviving Greek and Roman legends. Carthage had an excellent harbor, and the city was well situated to form a maritime empire based on Mediterranean trade. As time passed and Carthage expanded, it gained control over the other Phoenician colonies on the northern coast of Africa. Carthaginian merchants dominated trade in the western Mediterranean, and navigators may have sailed as far as Britain and Nigeria. The rise of Carthage in power and influence would bring it into conflict with first the Greek city-states of Sicily, and later the Roman Republic.[PARAGRAPH:2]Carthage's government was an oligarchy not unlike that in republican Rome. One or two "Sofetim" (which best translates as "judges") were elected annually from among the wealthy and influential families of Carthage to hold positions of executive and judicial power. These aristocratic families were also represented in a deliberative body that appears to have been similar to the Roman Senate. Although Carthage was primarily controlled by these oligarchs, there were also a few limited elections for minor positions of authority within the government.[PARAGRAPH:2]Carthage's economic prosperity was based largely upon its lucrative trade with the silver and tin mines of Spain, and those trade routes were jealously guarded by Carthaginian merchants. Culturally, the Carthaginians practiced the polytheistic religion of the Phoenicians, based upon worship of the divine couple Tanit and Ba'al. The Carthaginians also appear to have participated in the unsavory practice of child sacrifice as part of their religion, although some historians have disputed this.[PARAGRAPH:2]Carthage first came into military conflict with the Greeks over control of the island of Sicily, whose strategic location would allow the Carthaginians to control access to the western Mediterranean. Carthage fought three separate wars against the Greek colonies on Sicily, all of which largely ended in inconclusive stalemates.[PARAGRAPH:2]Eventually Rome occupied the Greek colonies in the south of mainland Italy, allowing Carthage an opportunity to conquer most of Sicily. Tension between the two states soon boiled over into the First Punic War (264 - 241 BC) during which the Romans recovered from initial setbacks and built a navy for the first time, with which they defeated the Carthaginians at the Battle of the Aegates Islands. This victory won Sicily for Rome, and the two sides entered into an uneasy peace.[PARAGRAPH:2]After losing Sicily to the Romans, the Carthaginians expanded their holdings in Spain to compensate. They also began to prepare for a second conflict with Rome. The war faction was led by the members of the Barca family, and in particular the soon-to-be-famous Hannibal. When a border dispute in Spain provoked an incident between the two states, the Carthaginian senate declared war, initiating the Second Punic War (218 - 202 BC).[PARAGRAPH:2]During this conflict Hannibal was authorized to lead a campaign into Italy. He led his large force - which included war elephants - across the Alps, taking the Romans completely by surprise (and creating one of the most enduring war stories of all time). Hannibal met and soundly defeated the main Roman army at Lake Trasimene (217). Despite this disaster the Romans mustered up an even larger army the following year. The two forces met at Cannae, and employing a series of brilliant tactical maneuvers, Hannibal once again utterly destroyed the Romans.[PARAGRAPH:2]Following this grisly slaughter, the Romans adopted a Fabian strategy of retreat, refusing to give battle against Hannibal. Hannibal continued to devastate the Italian countryside for the next decade, but he was unable to knock Rome out of the war. Meanwhile, the Roman general Scipio attacked Carthage's holdings in Spain, gaining complete control of the region by 206. Scipio then led an expedition to Africa itself, and Hannibal was recalled from Italy to defend the city of Carthage. The two sides met at the Battle of Zama in 202 BC and Hannibal was defeated, Scipio taking the name "Africanus" to celebrate his victory. Carthage was forced to sue for peace, and Rome imposed very harsh terms on the city.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite the destruction of the Second Punic War and the harsh peace terms, Carthage soon recovered her strength and began once more to exert control over trade in the Western Mediterranean. This caused great fear among the Romans, who had never forgotten the damage that Hannibal had done to Italy in the earlier war. In 149 BC Rome declared war on Carthage again on spurious pretexts, initiating the Third Punic War. The Carthaginians attempted to negotiate a settlement, but the Romans would be satisfied with nothing less than the cities total destruction. After a long siege, the city fell and its people were killed or sold into slavery. Carthage itself was pulled apart brick by brick and completely destroyed. The city would be rebuilt by the Romans, but the former Phoenician state would never rise again.</English>

		<Chinese>迦太基是北非一个古老的城邦，位于现代突尼斯遗址附近。公元前814年左右，腓尼基殖民者从提尔城定居下来。根据传统，第一位统治者是一位名叫迪多的王后，在许多现存的希腊和罗马传说中都有提及。迦太基有一个很好的港口，城市地理位置优越，可以在地中海贸易的基础上形成一个海上帝国。随着时间的推移和迦太基扩张，它控制了非洲北部海岸的其他腓尼基殖民地。迦太基商人主导了西地中海地区的贸易，航海者可能远航至英国和尼日利亚。迦太基在权力和影响力上的崛起将使它与西西里岛的希腊城邦以及后来的罗马共和国发生冲突。[段：2 ] Carthage政府是一个寡头政体，与共和国罗马没有任何不同。每年从迦太基富有和有影响力的家庭中选出一到两名“索菲特”（最好译为“法官”），担任行政和司法权力。这些贵族家庭也在一个类似于罗马元老院的审议机构中有代表。虽然Carthage主要是由这些寡头控制的，但在政府内部也很少有选举权的少数职位。[段：2 ] Carthage的经济繁荣很大程度上是基于其与西班牙银矿和锡矿的有利可图的贸易，迦太基商人小心翼翼地守卫着这些贸易路线。在文化上，迦太基人信奉腓尼基人的多神宗教，建立在对神圣的塔尼特和巴阿夫妇的崇拜之上。迦太基人似乎也参与了作为他们宗教的一部分的儿童牺牲的恶行，尽管一些历史学家对此持怀疑态度。[段落：2 ]迦太基首次与希腊人发生军事冲突，控制西西里岛，其战略位置将允许迦太基人控制进入。去西地中海。迦太基与西西里岛的希腊殖民地进行了三次独立战争，所有这些都以不确定的僵局结束。[段落：2 ]罗马最终占领了意大利大陆南部的希腊殖民地，让迦太基征服了大部分西西里岛。两国之间的紧张关系很快演变成了第一次布匿战争（公元前264-241年），罗马人在战争中从最初的挫折中恢复过来，第一次建立了海军，并在爱国舰群岛战役中击败了迦太基人。这次胜利为罗马赢得了西西里岛，双方陷入了一种不安的和平。[段：2 ]在西西里岛输给罗马人之后，迦太基人扩大了他们在西班牙的补偿。他们也开始准备与罗马的第二次冲突。战争派系由巴萨家族成员领导，特别是即将成名的汉尼拔。当西班牙的边界争端挑起两个州之间的事件时，迦太基参议院宣战，发动第二次布匿战争（公元前218年至202年）。[段：2 ]在这场冲突中，汉尼拔被授权领导一场战役进入意大利。他率领包括战象在内的庞大部队穿越阿尔卑斯山，让罗马人大吃一惊（并创造了有史以来最持久的战争故事之一）。汉尼拔在特拉西门尼湖（公元217年）与罗马大军会师并大败。尽管发生了这场灾难，罗马人在第二年集结了一支更大的军队。这两种力量在坎尼相遇，并采取了一系列精彩的战术演习，汉尼拔再次彻底摧毁了罗马人。[段：2 ]在这场惨烈屠杀之后，罗马人采取了Fabian撤退的策略，拒绝与汉尼拔作战。汉尼拔在接下来的十年里继续摧毁意大利的乡村，但他没能把罗马赶出战争。与此同时，罗马将军西皮奥攻击了迦太基在西班牙的领地，以206年的速度完全控制了该地区。随后，西皮奥率领一支探险队前往非洲，汉尼拔被召回意大利，保卫迦太基城。双方在公元前202年的萨马战役中相遇，汉尼拔战败，西皮奥以“非洲人”的名字庆祝他的胜利。Carthage被迫诉诸和平，罗马对这个城市施加了非常苛刻的条件。[第2段]，尽管第二次布匿战争和苛刻的和平条件被破坏，迦太基很快恢复了她的力量，并开始再次控制西地中海的贸易。这在罗马人中引起了极大的恐惧，他们从未忘记汉尼拔在早期战争中对意大利造成的损害。公元前149年，罗马以虚假的借口再次向迦太基宣战，发动了第三次布匿战争。迦太基人试图通过谈判达成和解，但罗马人只会满足于城市的彻底毁灭。经过长时间的围攻，这座城市倒塌了，它的人民被杀或被卖为奴隶。迦太基自己被一块一块地拆开，完全被摧毁了。这座城市将由罗马人重建，但前腓尼基人的国家将永远不会再崛起。</Chinese>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_CONCEPT_STABILITY_INFLUENCES_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[H1]Stability Influence Factors[\H1]
[NEWLINE][BOLD]EXPANSION[\BOLD]
[NEWLINE][BOLD]Overextension[\BOLD]
Overextension is the main factor of expansion stability. It depends on two scores:
[ICON_BULLET]core population score
[ICON_BULLET]periphery population score
[NEWLINE]Without taking modifiers into account, they are just the population in your core and the population outside of your core, respectively. As long as your periphery population score is below your core population score, everything is fine. Once the periphery score exceeds 100% of the core population score, you will receive an expansion stability penalty according to a formula which I will explain later. The scores are affected by a number of modifiers and therefore aren't only based on city population.
[NEWLINE]The [BOLD]core population score[\BOLD] is multiplied by your current era plus one. Since the modifier is era-based, your ability to support a large periphery grows during the game.
[NEWLINE]The [BOLD]periphery population score[\BOLD] for every city is based on many different factors. Since a lower periphery score is better for stability, negative modifiers are desired.
+2 if the city is not on historical territory (so it makes sense to mainly control historical tiles)
+1 if you are not the original owner of this city (unless you are running Totalitarianism, or the city is under your control for more than 25 turns)
+1 if you have less than 50% culture in this city
+1 if you have less than 20% culture in this city (those two penalties are cumulative, for a total of +2 if you are below 20%. Culture counts double within their civilization's own cores. Persia is immune to culture-based penalties due to their UP)
+1 if it is a historical overseas city and you are running Totalitarianism
-1 if the city has a Courthouse
-1 if the city has a Jail
-1 if it is a historical overseas city and you are running Colonialism
-1 if it is an overseas city and you are Portugal (their UP)

[NEWLINE]In addition to city population, each Village and Town in your core counts as one core population.
[NEWLINE]The expansion penalty can be at most -25, and grows faster right after the periphery score exceeds the core score than later on. This allows a diminishing yet growing effect of expansion stability that allows playing Domination games without making expansion stability irrelevant in more historical games.
[NEWLINE]Between stability checks, the overextension penalty can only increase by at most 5 negative points. For instance, if you had a penalty of 0 in the last check and the calculation results in -10, you will still only get a penalty of -5 until the next check.
[NEWLINE]Adopting Isolationism and keeping your periphery population at 10 or lower will give you +10 stability.
[NEWLINE][BOLD]Recent Expansion[\BOLD]
Founding and conquering cities in your historical area provides positive stability. The effect lasts for 20 turns from when the city has been acquired. The stability from recently conquered cities is higher when running Conquest and due to the Persian UP.
[NEWLINE][BOLD]Razing[\BOLD]
You get a -10 stability penalty for every city you have razed. This penalty decays by 2 points every 5 turns. This penalty is global, that means if you accrue -20 raze stability from razing two cities, it still decays by 2 points every 5 turns, instead of by 4. The exception to this rule are smaller cities. If the city has never had a population of more than 5, the penalty is -2 * [highest population the city has had] instead. This exception does not apply to another civilizations capital, which always gives a -10 penalty when razed.
Barbarian-owned cities will not count for this penalty, while cities owned by minor civilizations are worth only half of the usual penalty points.
[NEWLINE][BOLD]ECONOMY[\BOLD]
[NEWLINE][BOLD]Economic Growth[\BOLD]
The economic growth score is updated every third turn, in which the total amount of commerce produced is compared to the amount from three turns earlier. Has it grown by more than 5%, the score increases, has it shrunk by more than 5%, it decreases. Otherwise the score slowly moves towards 0 again. At every stability check the score is directly applied to the economy stability.
[NEWLINE][BOLD]DOMESTIC[\BOLD]
[NEWLINE][BOLD]Happiness[\BOLD]
Happiness stability works similar to economic growth stability in that it is accumulating every third turn depending on the situation of your civilization. To that end, the happy and unhappy cities in a civilization are counted based on the following criteria:
[NEWLINE][BOLD]Happy city:[\BOLD] currently celebrates the "We Love the King" day OR its happiness exceeds its unhappiness by at least a quarter of your empire's average city size and it has at least the average city size of your empire
[BOLD]Unhappy city:[\BOLD] the city has more unhappiness than happiness OR the extra unhappiness (from all factors except population) exceeds a fifth of the city's population
[NEWLINE]Note that it is possible for a city to not fulfill either of these criteria, in which case it doesn't count at all for the purposes of happiness stability. A city can also both fulfill the criteria for being happy and unhappy, in which case it counts as happy. Your happiness stability grows every third turn if you have more happy than unhappy cities, and declines if you have more unhappy than happy cities. This factor cannot exceed -5 or 5, respectively. If the amount of happy and unhappy cities is exactly the same, the value slowly approaches 0 again.
[NEWLINE][BOLD]Religion[\BOLD]
For religions, two or three percentages are calculated:
[ICON_BULLET]the percentage of cities that have your state religion (believer ratio)
[ICON_BULLET]the percentage of cities that have at least one non-state religion (heathen ratio)
[ICON_BULLET]if you are running Theocracy, the percentage of cities that have ONLY your state religion
[NEWLINE]Some non-state religions are ignored for the purposes of the second and third ratios ("tolerance").
[ICON_BULLET]civs with either Tolerance or Secularism tolerate all non-state religions
[ICON_BULLET]Hinduism and Buddhism tolerate each other
[ICON_BULLET]Confucianism and Taoism tolerate each other
[NEWLINE][BOLD]Heathen ratio:[\BOLD] You incur neither penalties nor bonuses if your ratio is 30%. Otherwise, you receive -1 stability for every 10% over 30% and +1 stability for every 10% below 30%.
[BOLD]Believer ratio:[\BOLD] You incur neither penalties nor bonuses if your ratio is 75%. Otherwise, you receive -1 stability for every 5% below 75% (up to a maximum of -10) and +1 stability for every 5% over 75%.
[BOLD]Theocracy bonus:[\BOLD] if you are running Theocracy, you also receive +1 stability for every 20% of your cities that only have your state religion.
[NEWLINE]Note that while the other factors require you to have a state religion, the religion stability from the heathen ratio also applies when you don't have a state religion.
[NEWLINE][BOLD]Civics[\BOLD]
Civics stability comes either from running a certain combination of civics or from running specific civics in a certain era or after discovering a certain technology.

[NEWLINE][BOLD]FOREIGN[\BOLD]
[NEWLINE]Several factors contribute to your foreign stability rating:
[NEWLINE][BOLD]Vassal stability[\BOLD]
Vassals receive +4 stability for every stability level their master exceeds them by

Masters receive:

For every collapsing vassal: -3
For every unstable vassal: -1
For every solid vassal: +2

For every vassal when running Tributaries: +2

[BOLD]Relations stability[\BOLD]
If civilisations we know have overall more favourable than unfavourable impressions of us (different relationship factors in the diplomacy tooltip), we receive positive stability, otherwise negative stability. The impact of the effect increases if the relationship factors are at three or more.

For every player that is more powerful and sees you as their worst enemy: -3

With Isolationism, relations stability can never be negative, and positive relations stability is halved.

[BOLD]Defensive Pact stability[\BOLD]

For every civilisation with a higher score we have a defensive pact with: +3

With Multilateralism, for every civilisation we have a defensive pact with: +3

[BOLD]Civic specific foreign stability[\BOLD]

For every neighbor you are at war with while running Nationhood: +2
For every civilization you are at war with while running Multilateralism: -2
For every civilization with different state religion you are at war with while running Theocracy: +3
For every civilization with the same state religion you are at war with while running Theocracy: -2
[NEWLINE][BOLD]MILITARY[\BOLD]
[NEWLINE]All military scores are calculated for each war your civilization is in.
[NEWLINE][BOLD]Conquest Stability[\BOLD]
This factor depends on the number of cities you have conquered from this civ compared to those you have lost to it. Cities are worth more if the owner has less of them, i.e. losing a city has a larger impact if you don't have a lot of them in the first place.
[NEWLINE][BOLD]Battle Stability[\BOLD]
Similar to conquest stability, the battles you have won are compared to the battles you have lost. In either case, a battle is "worth" as much as the defeated unit's power rating. How much battle stability you get or lose depends on your overall military strength - the stronger you are, the less of an impact a singular battle has in either way. Battle stability decays while a war lasts.
[NEWLINE][BOLD]War Weariness Stability[\BOLD]
Your war weariness is compared to your enemy's. If it is larger, you receive a penalty proportional to the difference. This penalty also decays while the war lasts.
[NEWLINE][BOLD]Barbarian Losses Stability[\BOLD]
You receive a -1 stability penalty for every battle you lose against a barbarian unit. This penalty also decays over time.</English>

		<Chinese>[H1]稳定性影响因素[\H1]
[NEWLINE] [BOLD]1.扩张因素[\BOLD]
[NEWLINE] [BOLD]1.1过度扩展[\BOLD]
过度膨胀是影响扩张稳定性的主要因素。这取决于两个因素：
[ICON_BULLET]核心人口得分
[ICON_BULLET]周边人口得分
[NEWLINE]如果不考虑修正值，它们分别只是核心区域的人口和核心区域以外的人口。只要外围人口分数低于核心人口分数，一切就可以了。一旦外围分数超过核心人口分数的100％，您将受到扩展稳定性惩罚。分数受许多修正值的影响，因此不仅取决于城市人口。
[NEWLINE] [BOLD]核心人口得分[\BOLD]等于核心人口乘以您当前时代修正值再+1。由于修正值是基于时代的，因此在游戏过程中，您支持大型帝国的能力会增强。
[NEWLINE]每个城市的[BOLD]周边人口得分[\BOLD]基于许多不同的因素。由于较低的外围分数对稳定性更好，因此需要负改性剂。
如果城市不在历史领土上，修正值+2（因此主要控制历史图块很有意义）
如果您不是该城市的原始所有者，修正值+1（除非您正在运行极权主义，或者该城市在您的控制下超过25个回合）
如果您的城市文化不到50％，修正值+1
如果您在这个城市的文化少于20％，修正值+1（如果累积了这两种刑罚，则低于20％，则总共是+2。文化在其文明的核心范围内加倍。波斯不受基于文化的刑罚的影响由于他们的UP）
+1，如果它是一个历史悠久的海外城市，并且您正在运行极权主义
如果城市有法院，则修正值-1
如果城市有监狱，则修正值-1
-1（如果它是一个历史悠久的海外城市并且您正在殖民）
-1，如果它是海外城市并且您是葡萄牙（他们的UP）    

[NEWLINE]除了城市人口外，您核心地区的每个乡镇都算作一个核心人口。
[NEWLINE]扩展惩罚最多可为-25，并且在外围得分超过核心得分后立即会比以后更快地增长。这会导致扩展稳定性的影响逐渐减弱，但这种增长势头正在扩大，它使您可以玩“统治”游戏，而又不会使扩展稳定性与更多历史游戏无关。
[NEWLINE]在稳定性检查之间，过分延长的罚款最多只能增加5个负点。例如，如果您在上次检查中的惩罚为0，而计算结果为-10，则在下一次检查之前，您仍然只会得到-5的惩罚。
[NEWLINE]采用孤立主义并将外围人口保持在10或更低的水平将使您获得+10的稳定性。

[NEWLINE] [BOLD]1.2最近扩展[\BOLD]
在您的历史区域内建立和征服城市可以带来积极的稳定。从获得该城市开始，该效果持续20回合。在运行“征服”游戏和波斯战后，最近被征服的城市的稳定性更高。
[NEWLINE] [BOLD]疯狂[\BOLD]
您要夷为平地的每个城市都会受到-10稳定度的惩罚。此惩罚每5圈衰减2点。此惩罚是全球性的，这意味着，如果您通过夷为平地攻击两个城市而获得-20狂暴稳定性，则它每5回合仍会衰减2点，而不是4点。这条规则是较小的城市。如果该城市的人口从未超过5，则罚款为-2 * [该城市最高人口]。此例外不适用于另一个文明之都，在被夷为平地时始终会处以-10的罚款。
蛮族拥有的城市将不计入这一罚款，而小文明拥有的城市仅值通常罚款点的一半。

[NEWLINE] [BOLD]2.经济[\BOLD]
[NEWLINE] [BOLD]2.1经济增长[\BOLD]
经济增长得分每三轮更新一次，其中将产生的商业总量与前三轮的总量进行比较。如果增长超过5％，得分会提高，如果收缩超过5％，则得分会下降。否则，分数将再次缓慢趋向于0。在每次稳定性检查时，分数都直接应用于经济稳定性。

[NEWLINE] [BOLD]3.内政[\BOLD]
[NEWLINE] [BOLD]3.1幸福[\BOLD]
幸福稳定与经济增长稳定的相似之处在于，它每三步积累一次，具体取决于您的文明状况。为此，根据以下标准计算文明中幸福和不幸福的城市：
[NEWLINE] [BOLD]幸福的城市：[\BOLD]当前正在庆祝“我们爱国王”的日子，或者它的幸福超过其不快乐的程度至少是整个帝国平均城市规模的四分之一，并且其平均城市规模至少为你的帝国
[BOLD]城市不开心：[\BOLD]城市的不幸福感大于幸福，或者额外的不快乐感（除人口以外的所有因素）超过城市人口的五分之一
[NEWLINE]请注意，一个城市可能不符合以上两个条件中的任何一个，在这种情况下，出于幸福稳定的考虑，这座城市根本就不算在内。一个城市也可以同时满足快乐和不快乐的标准，在这种情况下，它就算是快乐。如果您比不快乐的城市快乐，您的幸福感稳定度每增加三转，而如果您比不快乐的城市快乐，则幸福感稳定性就会降低。该因子不能分别超过-5或5。如果幸福和不幸福的城市数量完全相同，则该值将再次缓慢接近0。


[NEWLINE] [BOLD]3.2宗教信仰[\BOLD]
对于宗教，计算两个或三个百分比：
[ICON_BULLET]有您的州宗教信仰的城市所占的比例（信徒比例）
[ICON_BULLET]至少拥有一种非国有宗教的城市百分比（异教徒比例）
[ICON_BULLET]如果您运行的是神权统治，则是仅拥有您的州宗教信仰的城市所占的百分比。       [NEWLINE]出于第二和第三比率（“宽容”）的目的，一些非国教被忽略。
[ICON_BULLET]具有宽容或世俗主义的公民可以容忍所有非国家宗教
[ICON_BULLET]印度教和佛教互相容忍

[NEWLINE] [BOLD]健康比率：[\BOLD]如果您的比率为30％，则不会产生罚款或奖金。否则，对于30％以上的每10％，您将获得-1稳定性；对于30％以下的每10％，您将获得+1稳定性。

Their primary motivations for leaving the Cape were to escape British rule and extract themselves from the constant border wars between the British imperial government and the tribes on the eastern frontier.[NEWLINE][TAB]On 31 May 1961, the South Africa became a republic following a referendum in which white voters narrowly voted in favour thereof (the British-dominated Natal province rallied against the issue). Queen Elizabeth II was stripped of the title Queen of South Africa, and the last Governor-General, namely Charles Robberts Swart, became State President. As a concession to the Westminster system, the presidency remained parliamentary appointed and virtually powerless until P. W. Botha's Constitution Act of 1983, which (intact in these regards) eliminated the office of Prime Minister and instated a near-unique "strong presidency" responsible to parliament. Pressured by other Commonwealth of Nations countries, South Africa left the organisation in 1961 and was readmitted only in 1994.</English>

Warfare was a fact of life between the city-states of lower Mesopotamia, but it was during a battle between the King of Lagash and the King of Umma in 2525 BC that something exceptional occurred.[PARAGRAPH:1]After a resounding victory over the King of Umma, the King of Lagash erected a stele to commemorate the occasion. In commissioning this monument to his victory, the King of Lagash created the first known depiction of war ever created by humanity. The stele's carvings display the troops of Lagash: spearmen arranged in a phalanx formation, with eight men to a row, six rows deep. (As a phalanx arrangement would require strict training and discipline, this suggests that the Sumerians had one of the earliest professional armies.)

In Spain, though he is often referred to as Carlos V, he ruled officially as Carlos I, hence Charles I of Spain.[PARAGRAPH:2] Charles V's reign introduced the first documented use of the styles of His Majesty or His Imperial Majesty. Because of his far-reaching territories he was described as ruling an Empire "in which the sun does not set". Born in 1500, Charles inherited a vast empire from his parents. When his father Philip I died in 1516 Charles inherited control over The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Artois and Franche-Comte (or Free County of Burgundy). In 1516 his maternal grandfather Ferdinand II died and he inherited Aragon, Navarre, Granada, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, Spanish America, and joint kingship with his mother (who was insane) over Castile. Then in 1519 when his grandfather Maximilian I died, Charles inherited the Hapsburg lands in Austria and was elected Holy Roman emperor.[PARAGRAPH:2] During Charles' reign, the territories in New Spain were considerably extended by conquistadores like Hernan Cortes and Francisco Pizarro, who brought the Aztec and Inca empires to fall in little more than a decade. Combined with the circumnavigation of the globe in 1522, this gave to Charles a strong impression of his divine mission to become the leader of a christian world. The conquests also provided the state treasury with enormous amounts of bullion. The conquistador Bernal Diaz had already observed: "We came to serve God and our Majesty, ... and also to get rich." In 1550, Charles convened a conference at Valladolid in order to consider the morality of the force used against the indigenous populations of Spanish America. Charles was also known for introducing slaves from Spain to this region.[PARAGRAPH:2] In 1556 Charles abdicated his various titles, giving his personal empire to his son, Philip II of Spain, and the Holy Empire to his brother, Ferdinand. Charles retired to the monastery of Yuste in Extremadura, but continued to correspond widely and kept an interest in the situation of the empire. He suffered from severe gout and some scholars think Charles V decided to abdicate after a gout attack in 1552 forced him to postpone an attempt to recapture the French city of Metz, where he was later defeated. Charles died on September 21, 1558. Twenty-six years later his remains were transferred to the Royal Pantheon of The Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial.</English>

In 1516 his maternal grandfather Ferdinand II died and he inherited Aragon, Navarre, Granada, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, Spanish America, and joint kingship with his mother (who was insane) over Castile. Then in 1519 when his grandfather Maximilian I died, Charles inherited the Hapsburg lands in Austria and was elected Holy Roman emperor. [PARAGRAPH:2] During Charles' reign, the territories in New Spain were considerably extended by conquistadores like Hernan Cortes and Francisco Pizarro, who brought the Aztec and Inca empires to fall in little more than a decade. Combined with the circumnavigation of the globe in 1522, this gave to Charles a strong impression of his divine mission to become the leader of a christian world. The conquests also provided the state treasury with enormous amounts of bullion. The conquistador Bernal Diaz had already observed: "We came to serve God and our Majesty, ... and also to get rich." In 1550, Charles convened a conference at Valladolid in order to consider the morality of the force used against the indigenous populations of Spanish America. Charles was also known for introducing slaves from Spain to this region. [PARAGRAPH:2] In 1556 Charles abdicated his various titles, giving his personal empire to his son, Philip II of Spain, and the Holy Empire to his brother, Ferdinand. Charles retired to the monastery of Yuste in Extremadura, but continued to correspond widely and kept an interest in the situation of the empire. He suffered from severe gout and some scholars think Charles V decided to abdicate after a gout attack in 1552 forced him to postpone an attempt to recapture the French city of Metz, where he was later defeated. Charles died on September 21, 1558. Twenty-six years later his remains were transferred to the Royal Pantheon of The Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial.</Chinese>

When these principles are written down into a single document or set of legal documents, those documents may be said to embody a written constitution; if they are written down in a single comprehensive document, it is said to embody a codified constitution.

The model proposed that constitutional governments should be stable, adaptable, accountable, open and should represent the people (i.e., support democracy). The United States Constitution, ratified June 21, 1788, was influenced by the writings of Polybius, Locke, Montesquieu, and others.

A member of the Solomonic Dynasty, which traced its heritage back to the Biblical King Solomon, Zara Yaqob was an extremely devout, if occasionally draconian, ruler. Confined to the Amba Geshen prison for the early years of his life due to being a potential threat to his brother Tewodros's grip on the throne, Zara Yaqob only gained monarchal power in 1434 after his brother's death.[PARAGRAPH:2]As a highly religious leader, Zara Yaqob introduced many reformations and innovations in daily living based off his beliefs. Christmas was celebrated monthly in addition to many other feasts and celebrations. All thirty three festivals to the Virgin Mary were celebrated as if they were on the Sabbath, regardless of the actual day of the week on which they fell.[PARAGRAPH:2]Zara Yaqob was strict in his religious beliefs. Citizens who did not rigidly follow the prescripts of the Christian Church and adorn themselves with religious markings were put to death. If a person admitted to, or was accused of, worshipping the devil (or another non-Christian god), they were put to death. Even Zara Yaqob's own family was not sheltered from these punishments. Several were beaten and put to death, including his own wife, in an effort to give credibility to his harsh punishments, which were widely criticized.[PARAGRAPH:2]After a conspiracy organized by one of his subordinates came to light early in his reign, Zara Yaqob started exhibiting signs of paranoia. He began replacing all of his higher officials with female family members whom he felt he could trust. The emperor eventually attempted to appoint his own sisters, daughters and nieces to various governorships. Due to this paranoia, Zara Yaqob's reign is distinguished as being uniquely female dominated in a time when men traditionally held the majority of social power.[PARAGRAPH:2]Zara Yaqob also sent several diplomatic missions into Europe and India in both an attempt to create alliances against the rising Middle Eastern Islamic powers and to bring skilled workers and artisans into his country.[PARAGRAPH:2]Known mostly for his draconian religious laws, Zara Yaqob none the less was a practical leader and managed to protect Ethiopian interests from outside influence for the duration of his reign. Several of his progressive writings on religion, including the Mashafa Berha and the Mashafa Milad, are still available today.</English>

He is known as a great warlord and a great ruler. He created one of the largest empires the world had seen, and he ruled his subjects with fairness and compassion. Cyrus also founded Pasargade, the capital city of Persia.[PARAGRAPH:2]At the time of Cyrus's birth, Iran was divided between two major tribes: the Persians and the Medes. Ascending to the Persian throne, Cyrus conquered the Medes. He joined the two tribes together, creating the country of Persia. To ensure full cooperation of the newly-conquered Medes, he allowed their nobles to become government officials and gave them equal status with the Persian nobility.[PARAGRAPH:2]Once he had secured Persia, Cyrus turned his attention to the east. He conquered Drangiana, Arachosia, Margiana, and Bactra. He built a series of fortified towns along the border to secure his flank and protect his empire from the nomads of Asia. He then turned west, conquering mighty Babylon.[PARAGRAPH:2]As a civil leader, Cyrus was progressive far beyond his time. He left the institutions in conquered lands alone, allowing the people to largely govern themselves. He didn't meddle with local religions, and he tried to put an end to religious persecution - when he conquered Babylon, the Jews there welcomed him as liberator. In fact, he freed about 40,000 Jews from bondage in Babylon, allowing them to return to their homes in Palestine.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the early part of his rule, Cyrus issued a decree on his objectives. This decree is now recognized as the first declaration of human rights. When he died, Cyrus was mourned by millions, including his conquered subjects. The Hellenes called him "Law Giver," and the Jews named him the "Anointed of the Lord."</English>

		<English>[TAB]A steamship, often referred to as a steamer, is a type of steam powered vessel, typically ocean-faring and seaworthy, that is propelled by one or more steam engines that typically move (turn) propellers or paddlewheels. The first steamships came into practical usage during the early 1800s; however, there were exceptions that came before. Steamships usually use the prefix designations of "PS" for paddle steamer or "SS" for screw steamer (using a propeller or screw). As paddle steamers became less common, "SS" is assumed by many to stand for "steam ship". Ships powered by internal combustion engines use a prefix such as "MV" for motor vessel, so it is not correct to use "SS" for most modern vessels.[PARAGRAPH:2]As steamships were less dependent on wind patterns, new trade routes opened up. The steamship has been described as a "major driver of the first wave of trade globalization (1870鈥?913)" and contributor to "an increase in international trade that was unprecedented in human history".[PARAGRAPH:2]The steamship was preceded by smaller vessels designed for insular transportation, called steamboats. Once the technology of steam was mastered at this level, steam engines were mounted on larger, and eventually, ocean-going vessels. Becoming reliable, and propelled by screw rather than paddlewheels, the technology changed the design of ships for faster, more economic propulsion.[PARAGRAPH:2]Paddlewheels as the main motive source became standard on these early vessels. It was an effective means of propulsion under ideal conditions but otherwise had serious drawbacks.

		<English>[H1]Limited Resource Effects[\H1][NEWLINE]In Dawn of Civilization, the number of cities a resource can provide health or happiness to is limited. For example, each instance of the Silk only provides happiness to three cities in your empire. It is therefore necessary to secure multiple instances of a resource to supply all cities in a large empire. If a civilization does not control enough instances of a resource to supply all of its cities, the effect is applied to more cultured cities first. In consequence, it is advisable for large empires to focus on obtaining multiple instances of the same resource, while small civilizations should focus on a diverse set of resources. Note that these new rules only apply to health or happiness directly from resources. Health and happiness from resources with buildings remain unaffected, as well as all other resource effects (e.g. enabling units or providing power).</English>

		<English>[H1]Karl XII[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Sweden[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] June 17, 1682 - November 30, 1718 AD[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Carl XII, Karl XII or Carolus Rex, the Alexander of the North, nicknamed in Turkish as Demirbas Sarl (Charles the Habitu?, was a King of Sweden from 1697 until his death in 1718. He was the fourth king of the Wittelsbach dynasty in Sweden. As a child, many people thought he was going to be sickly. This was proved to be wrong, though: he hardened his body for war by riding on horseback and hunting the wolves of Sweden's fir forests. When his father died, he was ready. He came to the throne at the age of fifteen and left the country three years later to embark on a series of battles overseas, that briefly made Sweden the predominant power in Northern Europe. These battles were part of the Great Northern War, and many of them were fought against Peter the Great, Emperor of Russia. His youth gave other nations a decent pretext with which to invade Sweden; Saxony, Denmark-Norway, Poland and Russia joined in a coalition to attack Sweden, beginning the Great Northern War. Charles XII turned out to be more astute than the other powers imagined, a great tactician, defeating all of the invaders. However, his strong tactical abilities were not accompanied by strategic and political wisdom. He is quoted by Voltaire as saying upon the outbreak of the Great Northern War, "I have resolved never to start an unjust war but never to end a legitimate one except by defeating my enemies." He took this resolution to an extreme level, which eventually resulted in the end of the Swedish Empire and its dominance of the southern Baltic Sea.[PARAGRAPH:2]Charles's first campaign was against Denmark, ruled by his cousin Frederick IV of Denmark, which threatened a Swedish ally, Frederick IV of Holstein-Gottorp (another cousin of Charles XII, and married to his sister Hedvig Sophia). Denmark's defeat, however, and Sweden's ensuing rise to prominence in the Baltic region was viewed suspiciously by two powerful neighbors, King August II of Poland (cousin to both Charles XII and Frederick IV of Denmark) and Peter the Great of Russia. Russia responded by occupying the Swedish territories of Livonia and Estonia. Charles countered this by attacking the Russian garrison at Battle of Narva. From the very beginning, this seemed to be a headstrong move. The Swedish army of ten thousand men was outnumbered four to one by the Russians. Still, Charles attacked under cover of a blizzard, and effectively split the Russian army in two. Many of Peter's troops that fled the battlefield drowned in the Narva River and the battle was a crushing Swedish victory.[PARAGRAPH:2]Charles, despite advice from his advisors, didn't pursue the Russian army. Instead, he then turned against Poland-Lithuania, which was formally neutral at this point, disregarding Polish negotiation proposals, supported by the Swedish parliament. Charles defeated Polish king Augustus II and his Saxon allies at the Battle of Kliszow in 1702 and captured many important cities of the Commonwealth. After the deposition of the king of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Charles XII filled the void with his own man, Stanislas Leszczynski .[PARAGRAPH:2]Meanwhile, while Charles enjoyed easy victories in the Commonwealth, the Russian Tsar Peter the Great embarked on a giant military reform plan that soon begun to bear fruit. The new Russian army was a much tougher one than the one defeated at Narva. Russian forces had managed to retake Livonia and even established a new city Saint Petersburg there. This prompted Charles to make the fatal decision to attack the Russian heartland with an assault on Moscow, allying himself with Ivan Mazepa, ataman of the Cossacks. Peter the Great managed to cripple Swedish forces near the Baltic coast before Charles managed to combine his forces, and Charles' Polish ally, Stanislaw Leszczynski, was facing internal problems of his own. Charles expected the support of a massive Cossack rebellion led by Mazepa in Ukraine but the Russians destroyed the rebel army before they could aid the Swedes. The harsh climate took its toll as well, as Charles marched his troops through Ukraine. By the time of the decisive Battle of Poltava, Charles had been wounded, one-third of his infantry was dead, and his vulnerable supply train destroyed. The king himself, incapacitated by a coma resulting from his injuries, was unable to rally the Swedish forces. The battle was a disaster, and Charles fled south to the Ottoman Empire, where he set up camp at Bender with about 1000 men who were called Caroleans ("Karoliner" in Swedish). The Poltava Swedish disaster marked both the end of the Swedish Empire and the rise of Russian Empire.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Turks initially welcomed the Swedish king, who managed to incite a war between the Ottomans and the Russians. However the sultan Ahmed III eventually tired of Charles' endless scheming and ordered his arrest. Meanwhile, the king's old enemies Russia and Poland took advantage of his absence to regain and even expand their lost territories. England, an ally of the Swedes, defected from their alliance obligations while the Prussians also attacked Swedish holdings in Germany. Russia seized Finland and Augustus II regained the Polish throne.[PARAGRAPH:2]Seeing his very kingdom threatened, Charles fled the Ottoman Empire and rode across Europe in just fifteen days to return to Swedish Pomerania. His efforts to reestablish his lost empire failed, however, when he was killed by a bullet during his second siege of the fortress Fredriksten in Danish-controlled Norway. There has been some speculations that he was not killed by a stray bullet but by one fired from the Swedish side, making his death an assassination (at the time he was not very popular in Sweden due to the hardships the people suffered because of the constant wars) but a conclusion has never been reached. He was succeeded to the Swedish throne by his sister, Ulrika Eleanora.[PARAGRAPH:2]His death is one of countless trivial disagreements between Norway and Sweden, both sides claiming the kill. It is not uncommon for the Norwegian media to end articles concerning Sweden with the line PS: We shot Charles XII![PARAGRAPH:2]Exceptional for abstaining from alcohol and women, he felt most comfortable during warfare. Contemporaries report of his seemingly inhuman tolerance for pain and his utter lack of emotion. The king brought Sweden to its pinnacle of prestige and power through his brilliant campaigning. However, his over-ambitious invasion of Russia coupled with the overwhelming power of a revived anti-Swedish coalition brought Sweden's downfall as a Great Power.[PARAGRAPH:2]Apart from being a monarch, the King's interests included mathematics, and anything that would be beneficial to his warlike purposes. He is attributed to having invented an octal numeral system, which he considered more suitable for war purposes because of all cubic boxes used for materials such as gunpowder. According to a report by contemporary scientist Emanuel Swedenborg, the King had sketched down a model of his thought on a piece of paper and handed it to him at their meeting in Lund in 1716. The paper was reportedly still in existence a hundred years later, but has since been lost. Several historians of science suspect that either the multi-talented Emanuel Swedenborg or the brilliant inventor Christopher Polhem also present at the meeting in Lund 1716 may have been the true inventor behind this feat, or at least a main contributor.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Free Enterprise (also referred to as Laissez-faire economic policy) is an economic system in which transactions between private parties are free from government intervention such as regulation, privileges, tariffs, and subsidies. The doctrine of laissez-faire became an integral part of nineteenth-century European liberalism. Just as liberals supported freedom of thought in the intellectual sphere, so were they equally prepared to champion the principles of free trade and free competition in the sphere of economics. The state was to be merely a passive policeman, protecting private property and administering justice, but not interfering with the affairs of its citizens. Businessmen, and particularly British industrialists, were quick to associate these principles with their own economic interests.</English>

Usually a monastery will have strict rules of conduct to protect its unworldly members from temptation. In some monasteries, the monks are totally silent; in others no visitors are allowed inside. Monasteries usually have many daily rituals and religious services.[PARAGRAPH:1]Throughout the ages monasteries have often been centers of learning. In remote areas the monks may be the only literate people for miles around. Monks have often been employed as scribes, copying out the words of their religion's sacred scripture. Monasteries frequently have extensive libraries, holding religious, scientific, medical and philosophical texts.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sanghas, alternately also called Viharas, were originally created to provide places for the wandering Buddhist monks to make their annual retreats. Some Buddhist monks stay indoors during the three-month rainy season to avoid damaging new plant growth (and to avoid being stranded during inclement weather).

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_THEODOSIAN_WALLS_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]The original walls of Constantinople were built in the 8th century BC when Byzantium was founded by Greek colonists from Megara. At the time the city consisted of an acropolis and little more. The colony was relatively unimportant by the Roman period, but Septimius Severus built a new set of walls during his reign, bringing more land into the city. When Constantine moved the capital of the empire to Byzantium, which he renamed Constantinople, he greatly expanded the walls of the city, incorporating even more territory.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 412 the Roman emperor Theodosius II surrounded Constantinople with a wall that stretched 6.5 kilometers between the Sea of Marmara and the Golden Horn. Although named after Theodosius, they were actually constructed under the direction of Anthemius, Praetorian prefect of the Eastern Empire.[PARAGRAPH:1]The walls were built of stone and brick in two lines of defense which adjoined a ditch 20 meters wide and 10 meters deep. The inner wall had was 5 meters thick and 12 meters high. It was strengthened with 96 unapproachable towers 18-20 meters tall. The thickness of the external wall was 2 meters, and its height was 8.5 meters. The wall contained the Belgrad, Silivrikapi, Mevlevihane, Topkapi, Edirnekapi, Egrikapi and Yedikule gates. Yedikule Gate was also known as the "Porta Aurea" or "Golden Gate", and was the most magnificent, consisting of three archways. As the state entrance into the capital, the Golden Gate was architecturally splendid, and was built of large square blocks of polished marble fitted together without cement, and flanked by two great towers of the same material. Upon the gates were placed sculpted elephants.[PARAGRAPH:1]The inner walls had massive square or hexagonal towers. The southern end of the walls, at the Sea of Marmara, was the location of the Marble Tower. There were ten gates, the four major ones being the Golden Gate at the southern end, the Selymbria Gate leading to the Forum of Constantine and Hagia Sophia, the Adrianople Gate connecting Constantinople's Mese (the main street) with the city of Adrianople and the Via Egnatia, and the Blachernae Gate in the north.[PARAGRAPH:1]In 439 the first sea walls were built. In 447 the wall was damaged by an earthquake, but was quickly restored in time to stop Attila's army. In the northwestern corner of the city, in the suburb of Blachernae, the Theodosian walls were relatively weaker, but were expanded by Leo I. The northern coast of the city, along the Golden Horn, also had a separate set of walls.[PARAGRAPH:1]These walls were almost inpenetrable, saving the city during sieges from the Bulgars, Arabs, and Rus', among others. The first attackers to break through the walls were the knights of the Fourth Crusade, who managed to scale the lower sea walls and also break the Wall of Leo in the northwestern Blachernae section of the city.[PARAGRAPH:1]The second and final time the walls were breached was during the Siege of Constantinople in 1453, by the Ottomans; however, they did not break through by force, but entered through the Kerkoporta Gate, which happened to be open, apparently accidentally but possibly through treachery. A large plaque today marks the spot where the Ottomans entered. Mehmed had the walls repaired in short order among other massive public works projects. Within a few years, due to the renewed importance of the city as the new Ottoman capital, the population started to soar again.[PARAGRAPH:1]Under the Ottomans, the Golden Gate, known to them as Yedikule ("the Seven Towers"), was used as a prison. Many parts of the walls are still standing today and are a testament to the extraordinary longevity of the empire. They have been damaged by recent earthquakes, but many sections have also been restored. The wall runs through the suburbs of modern Istanbul, with a belt of parkland flanking their course.

An "Odeon" is a large, open-aired structure in which such performances were held. The audience sat in a semicircle of seats around a central paved "dancing square" (orchestra). The first row of seats was reserved for important officials or priests. There was usually an altar dedicated to Dionysus somewhere in the odeon. The "logeion" was a small raised platform where the performers acted (the original dramas had at most three or four actors; the size of the stage would increase as later plays required bigger casts).</English>

Cardoso noted that the region was famous in his day for the large amount of cloth that it produced, some of which was exported to the Portuguese colonial city of Luanda, Angola. Reports of the early 17th century suggest that the Seven Kingdoms exported as much as 100,000 meters of cloth annually to that market alone, suggesting that its total production must have been several times higher, putting in on a par with other major textile centers in the world, including areas of equivalent size in Europe and India.</English>

		<English>[H1]Harun al-Rashid[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Caliph of the Abbasid Caliphate[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 763 - 809 AD[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Harun al-Rashid, "Harun the Orthodox", the fifth of the Abbasid caliphs of Bagdad, and the second son of the third caliph Mahdi. His full name was Harun ibn Muhammad ibn Abdallah ibn Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Abdallah ibn Abbas. He was born at Rai (Rhagae) on the 20th of March AD 763, according to some accounts, and according to others on the 15th of February AD 766. Harun al-Rashid was twenty-two years old when he ascended the throne. His father Mahdi just before his death conceived the idea of superseding his elder son Musa (afterwards known as Hadi, the fourth caliph) by Harun. But on Mahdi's death Harun gave way to his brother.[PARAGRAPH:2]Rashid owed his succession to the throne to the prudence and sagacity of Yahya bin Khalid the Barmecide, his secretary, whom on his accession he appointed his lieutenant and grand vizier. Under his guidance the empire flourished on the whole, in spite of several revolts in the provinces by members of the old Alid family. Successful wars were waged with the rulers of Byzantium and the Khazars. In 803, however, Harun became suspicious of the Barmecides, whom with only a single exception he caused to be executed. Henceforward the chief power was exercised by Fadl bin Rabi, who had been chamberlain not only under Harun himself but under his predecessors, Mansur, Madhi and Hadi. In the later years of Harun's reign troubles arose in the eastern parts of the empire. These troubles assumed proportions so serious that Harun himself decided to go to Khorasan. He died, however, at Tus in March 809.[PARAGRAPH:2]The reign of Harun was one of the most brilliant in the annals of the caliphate, in spite of losses in northwest Africa and Transoxiana. His fame spread to the West, and Charlemagne and he exchanged gifts and compliments as masters respectively of the West and the East. No caliph ever gathered around him so great a number of learned men, poets, jurists, grammarians, cadis and scribes, to say nothing of the wits and musicians who enjoyed his patronage. Harun himself was a scholar and poet, and was well versed in history, tradition and poetry. He possessed taste and discernment, and his dignified demeanor is extolled by the historians. In religion he was extremely strict; he prostrated himself a hundred times daily, and nine or ten times made the pilgrimage to Mecca. At the same time he cannot be regarded as a great administrator. He seems to have left everything to his viziers Yahya and Fadl, to the former of whom especially was due the prosperous condition of the empire. Harun is best known to Western readers as the hero of many of the stories in the Arabian Nights; and in Arabic literature he is the central figure of numberless anecdotes and humorous stories. Of his incognito walks through Bagdad, however, the authentic histories say nothing. His Arabic biographers are unanimous in describing him as noble and generous, but there is little doubt that he was in fact a man of little force of character, suspicious, untrustworthy and on occasions cruel.</English>

The term "candi" itself derived from Candika, one of the manifestation of the goddess Durga as the goddess of death. This suggested in ancient Indonesia the "candi" has mortuary function as well as attributed with the afterlife. The association of the name "candi", candika or durga with Hindu-Buddhist temples is unknown in India and other of Indonesia's Southeast Asian neighbours such as Cambodia, Thailand, or Burma. The historians suggested that temples of ancient Java also used to store the ashes of cremated deceased kings or royalties. This is also in-line with buddhist concept of stupa  as the structure to store buddhist relicts including the ashes and remnants of holy buddhist priest or the buddhist king, the patron of buddhism. The statue of god stored inside the garbhagriha (main chamber) of the temple often modelled after the deceased king and considered as deified self of the king portrayed as Vishnu or Shiva. The example is the statue of king Airlangga from Belahan temple portrayed as Vishnu riding Garuda.[PARAGRAPH:1]Some of the more famous Candis are Borobudur, a Mahayana Buddhist monument in Central Java and the large Prambanan, dedicated to the Hindu god Trimurti, both built in the 9th century.</English>

		<English>[TAB]At the height of its power, the Mali Empire had a trading empire that stretched across Africa and into Europe, the Middle East, and Asia; the great wealth of the Mali Empire in large came from the rich gold mines of Bumbuk and Bure.[PARAGRAPH:1]Once the gold was extracted from the mine and purified, it needed to be shaped into a size and form that was easy for the Malinese to transport and to trade. Gold could be formed into large blocks or bars, but these were extremely heavy and cumbersome, and quite awkward to transport on horse/camelback. They were also so expensive that only governments and the very rich would be able to afford them, and so that form was usually reserved for large quantities of gold that were to be transported by ship. For smaller and more convenient uses, gold was formed into coins.[PARAGRAPH:1]A place where money is created is called a "mint." At a mint, the gold is melted and poured into a standardized coin form - or, in earlier times, it might be manually pounded and cut into shape. The coin is usually decorated with the ruler's head or some other recognizable symbol. The value of the gold coin is dependent upon the purity of the metal in the coin, and its weight. Throughout history the unscrupulous have attempted to pass off light or impure coins to unsuspecting purchasers. If widespread, this practice can seriously damage trade and cripple a nation's entire economy. To maintain a reputation for honest dealing, the Malinese needed to use fairly sophisticated measuring tools to ensure that their coins maintained a consistent value. This in turn spurred advancements in science and technology.</English>

It is important to know that nationalism can come in a variety of forms, some permutations bearing little resemblance to each other. Many early nationalistic leaders preached the superiority of their country over all others.

However, these early turtle ships soon fell out of use as Korea's naval preparedness decreased during a long period of relative peace.[PARAGRAPH:1]Turtle ships participated in numerous victories against Japanese naval forces that supported Toyotomi Hideyoshi's attempts to conquer Korea from 1592-1598, inflicting heavy losses. However, their historical role may have been exaggerated since "the entire Korean fleet probably did not have more than half a dozen turtleboats in action at any one time".

He served as a military officer in the Indonesian National Revolution, but is better known as the long-reigning second President of Indonesia, holding the office from 1967 to 1998.[PARAGRAPH:2]Suharto seized power from his predecessor, the first president of Indonesia Sukarno, through a mixture of force and political maneuvering against the backdrop of foreign and domestic unrest. Over the three decades of his "New Order" regime, Suharto constructed a strong central government along militarist lines. An ability to maintain stability and an avowedly anti-Communist stance won him the economic and diplomatic patronage of several Western governments in the era of the Cold War. For almost all of his three-decade rule, Indonesia experienced rapid industrialization and economic growth.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Suharto regime had won the favour of Western governments and institutions, however, in 1990's, its increasingly authoritarian and corrupt practices became a source of much discontent. After the 1990s brought end of the Cold War, Western concern over communism waned, and Suharto's human rights record came under greater international scrutiny. In 1991, the murder of East Timorese civilians in a Dili cemetery, also known as the "Santa Cruz Massacre", caused American attention to focus on its military relations with the Suharto regime and the question of Indonesia's occupation of East Timor. In 1992,this attention resulted in the Congress of the United States passing limitations on IMET assistance to the Indonesian military, over the objections of President George H.W. Bush. In 1993, under President Bill Clinton, the U.S. delegation to the UN Human Rights Commission helped pass a resolution expressing deep concern over Indonesian human rights violations in East Timor. The Indonesian invasion and occupation of East Timor has been called the worst instance of genocide (relative to population) since the Holocaust.[PARAGRAPH:2]His almost unquestioned authority over Indonesian affairs slipped dramatically when the Asian financial crisis lowered Indonesians' standard of living and fractured his support among the nation's military, political and civil society institutions. After internal unrest and diplomatic isolation sapped his support in the mid-to-late 1990s, Suharto was forced to resign from the presidency in May 1998.[PARAGRAPH:2]After serving as the public face of Indonesia for over 30 years, Suharto then lived his post-presidential years in virtual seclusion. His legacy remains hotly debated and contested both in Indonesia and in foreign-policy debates in the West. Since his resignation, Suharto retired to a family compound in Central Jakarta, making few public appearances. Efforts to prosecute Suharto have mostly centered around alleged mismanagement of funds, and their force has been blunted due to health concerns. In january 2008, Suharto was taken to the Pertamina hospital, Jakarta, with complications arising from a weak heart, swelling of limbs and stomach, and partial renal failure. He died there at 27th of January at 1:10 pm.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Prussia made early use of the title "fusilier" for various types of infantry. In 1705, the Foot Guards (Leibgarde zu Fuss) were designated as Fusilier Guards. By 1837, low-quality infantry raised from garrison companies also were named fusiliers. These latter units were dressed in blue with low mitre caps. Between 1740 and 1743 on Frederick the Great raised 14 separate Fusilier Regiments (numbers 33-40, 41-43 and 45-48). Except for the mitre caps, these new regiments were identical in appearance, training and role to the existing line infantry (musketeers).[PARAGRAPH:2]Subsequently, Prussia and several other German states used the designation Fusilier to denote a type of light infantry, dressed in green, that acted as skirmishers. In the Prussian Army, they had been formed in 1787 as independent battalions, with many of the Officers having had experience in the American Revolutionary War. The Prussian reforms of 1808 absorbed the fusiliers as the third battalion of each line infantry regiment. Now wearing the same Prussian blue uniforms as standard musketeers, they were distinguished by black leather belts, and a slightly different arrangement of cartridge pouch.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the Prussian Army of 1870, Infantry Regiments 33 to 40 plus Regiments 73 (Hanover), 80 (Hesse-Kassel or Hesse-Cassel) and 86 (Schleswig-Holstein) were all designated as fusiliers, as was the Guard Fusilier Regiment. In addition, the third battalions of all guard, grenadier and line infantry regiments retained the designation 'Fusilier Battalion'. They were armed with a slightly shorter version of the Dreyse rifle (F&#252;siliergewehr), that took a sword bayonet (F&#252;silier-Seitengewehr) rather than the standard socket bayonet. Although still theoretically skirmishers, in practice they differed little from their compatriots, as all Prussian infantry fought in a style that formed a dense 'firing' or 'skirmish' line.</English>

However, the term is generally associated with state spying on potential or actual enemies primarily for military purposes. Spying involving corporations is known as industrial espionage.[PARAGRAPH:1]One of the most effective ways to gather data and information about the enemy (or potential enemy) is by infiltrating the enemy's ranks. This is the job of the spy (espionage agent). Spies can bring back all sorts of information concerning the size and strength of an enemy army. They can also find dissidents within the enemy's forces and influence them to defect. In times of crisis, spies can also be used to steal technology and to sabotage the enemy in various ways. Counterintelligence operatives can feed false information to enemy spies, protecting important domestic secrets, and preventing attempts at subversion. Nearly every country has very strict laws concerning espionage, and the penalty for being caught is often severe. However, the benefits that can be gained through espionage are generally great enough that most governments and many large corporations make use of it to varying degrees.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Itsukushima Shrine is a Shinto shrine on the island of Itsukushima (popularly known as Miyajima) in the city of Hatsukaichi in Hiroshima Prefecture in Japan. The shrine complex is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the Japanese government has designated several buildings and possessions as National Treasures.[PARAGRAPH:2]The shrine is dedicated to the three daughters of Susano-o no Mikoto, Shinto deity of seas and storms and brother of the great sun deity, Amaterasu (tutelary deity of the Imperial Household). Because the island itself has been considered sacred, in order to maintain its purity commoners were not allowed to set foot on Miyajima through much of its history. In order to allow pilgrims to approach, the shrine was built like a pier over the water, so that it appeared to float, separate from the land, and therefore existed in a liminal state between the sacred and the profane. The shrine's signature red entrance gate, or torii, was built over the water for much the same reason. Commoners had to steer their boats through the torii before approaching the shrine.[PARAgraph:2]Retaining the purity of the shrine is so important that since 1878, no deaths or births have been permitted near the shrine. To this day, pregnant women are supposed to retreat to the mainland as the day of delivery approaches, as are terminally ill or the very elderly whose passing has become imminent. Burials on the island are still forbidden.[PARAGRAPH:2]The first shrine buildings were probably erected in the 6th century, and the shrine has been destroyed many times. The present shrine dates from the mid-16th century, and follows the earlier 12th century design. That design was established in 1168, when funds were provided by the warlord Taira no Kiyomori. The shrine was designed and built on pier-like structures over the bay so that it would appear to be floating on the water, separate from the sacred island, which could be approached by the devout. Near the main shrine is a noh stage, funded by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the late 16th century. Noh theater performances have long been used to pay honor to the gods, and ritually act out key events in the mythic history of Shinto belief.[PARAgraph:2]The dramatic gate, or torii, of Itsukushima Shrine is one of Japan's most popular tourist attractions, and the most recognizable and celebrated feature of the Itsukushima shrine, and the view of the gate in front of the island's Mount Misen is classified as one of the Three Views of Japan (along with the sand bar Amanohashidate, and Matsushima Bay). Although a gate has been in place since 1168, the current gate dates back to 1875. The gate, built of decay-resistant camphor wood, is about 16 metres high and was built in a four-legged style to provide additional stability.[PARAgraph:2]The torii only appears to be floating at high tide; when the tide is low, it is approachable by foot from the island. It is common practice for visitors to place coins in the cracks of the legs of the gate and make a wish. Gathering shellfish near the gate is also popular at low tide. Many locals add the shellfish they gather to their miso soup. At night, powerful lights on the shore illuminate the torii.[PARAgraph:2]On September 5, 2004, the shrine was severely damaged by Typhoon Songda. The boardwalks and roof were partially destroyed, and the shrine was temporarily closed for repairs.</English>

Small rivers may be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for generic terms, such as river, as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream may be defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are "run" in some parts of the United States, "burn" in Scotland and northeast England, and "beck" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.[PARAGRAPH:1]Rivers are part of the hydrological cycle. Water generally collects in a river from precipitation through a drainage basin from surface runoff and other sources such as groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (e.g. from glaciers).

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_WESTMINSTER_PALACE_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]The Palace of Westminster is the meeting place of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the two houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Commonly known as the Houses of Parliament after its tenants, the Palace lies on the Middlesex bank of the River Thames in the City of Westminster, in central London. Its name, which derives from the neighbouring Westminster Abbey, may refer to either of two structures: the Old Palace, a medieval building complex that was destroyed by fire in 1834, and its replacement New Palace that stands today. For ceremonial purposes, the palace retains its original style and status as a royal residence.[PARAGRAPH:1]The first royal palace was built on the site in the eleventh century, and Westminster was the primary London residence of the Kings of England until a fire destroyed much of the complex in 1512. After that, it served as the home of Parliament, which had been meeting there since the thirteenth century, and the seat of the Royal Courts of Justice, based in and around Westminster Hall. In 1834, an even greater fire ravaged the heavily rebuilt Houses of Parliament, and the only structures of significance to survive were Westminster Hall, the Cloisters of St Stephen's, the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft and the Jewel Tower.[PARAGRAPH:1]The subsequent competition for the reconstruction of the Palace was won by architect Charles Barry and his design for a building in the Perpendicular Gothic style. The remains of the Old Palace (with the exception of the detached Jewel Tower) were incorporated in its much larger replacement, which contains over 1,100 rooms organised symmetrically around two series of courtyards. Part of the New Palace's area of 3.24 hectares (8 acres) was reclaimed from the Thames, which is the setting of its principal fa&#231;ade, the 266-metre (873 ft) river front. Barry was assisted by Augustus W. N. Pugin, a leading authority on Gothic architecture and style, who provided designs for the decoration and furnishings of the Palace. Construction started in 1840 and lasted for thirty years, suffering great delays and cost overruns, as well as the death of both leading architects; works for the interior decoration continued intermittently well into the twentieth century. Major conservation work has been carried out since, due to the effects of London's air pollution, and extensive repairs took place after the Second World War, including the reconstruction of the Commons Chamber following its bombing in 1941.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Palace is one of the centers of political life in the United Kingdom; "Westminster" has become a metonym for the UK Parliament, and the Westminster system of government has taken its name after it. The Elizabeth Tower, in particular, which is often referred to by the name of its main bell, "Big Ben", is an iconic landmark of London and the United Kingdom in general, one of the most popular tourist attractions in the city and an emblem of parliamentary democracy. The Palace of Westminster has been a Grade I listed building since 1970 and part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The galleass (known as a "mahon" in Turkey) developed from large merchant galleys. Converted for military use they were higher and larger than regular ("light") galleys. They had up to 32 oars, each worked by up to 5 men. They usually had three masts and a forecastle and aftcastle. Much effort was made in Venice to make these galleasses as fast as possible to compete with regular galleys. The gun-deck usually ran over the rowers' heads, but there are also pictures showing the opposite arrangement. Galleasses usually carried more sails than true galleys, and were far deadlier; a galley caught broadside lay all but helpless, but coming broadside to a galleass, as with a ship of the line, exposed an attacker to her gunfire. The galleass exemplified an intermediate type between the galley and the true man-of-war. One disadvantage was that, being more reliant on sails, their position at the front of the galley line at the start of a battle could not be guaranteed but they were used at the Battle of Lepanto (7 October 1571), their firepower helping to win victory for the Christian fleet, and some sufficiently seaworthy galleasses accompanied the Spanish Armada in 1588. In the 15th century a type of light galleass, called the frigate, was built in southern European countries to answer the increasing challenge posed by the north African based Barbary pirates in their fast galleys.</English>

In 877 AD Wang Kon was born into a powerful merchant family in the city of Songdo, and his father Wang Yung was the wealthy leader of his clan. At this time Korea was divided between several different states struggling for dominance, and it was generally a period of disruption and chaos, as armies marched and countermarched across the war-ravaged peninsula. In 895 Songdo was occupied by a faction in rebellion against the main Korean state of Silla. The occupation forces were commanded by a man named Gung Ye. Young Wang Kon followed his father into Gung Ye's service, where he quickly demonstrated great military ability.[PARAGRAPH:2]Within a few years, Gung Ye had promoted Wang Kon to the rank of general. In 900, Wang Kon led a successful attack against the state of Hubaekje, and in 903 he launched a famous naval campaign against the southwestern coast of the same country. Wang Kon's mercy to the people he conquered won him a great deal of popularity and admiration even from his enemies. By 913, he was appointed the prime minister of the new state of Taebong, still under the service of (now king) Gung Ye.[PARAGRAPH:2]Unfortunately, Gung Ye proved to be a horrible ruler. Once in power he quickly turned into a religious despot, naming himself Buddha and executing those who challenged his religious claims. In a fit of rage, he executed his wife and two sons. Believing that their new king was quite mad, four of Taebong's major generals plotted to overthrow Gung Ye. Seeking a charismatic leader who would rally the people to their cause, they asked Wang Kon to become the movement's leader; Wang Kon agreed, and after Gung Ye was overthrown and killed in 918, he became the ruler of the kingdom. Once in power Wang Kon renamed his state "Goryeo."[PARAGRAPH:2]During his reign Wang Kon promoted Buddhism as the state religion, and oversaw the conquest of northern Korea and parts of Manchuria. When dealing with local clans, Wang Kon generally sought alliance and cooperation over conquest. When the rebel leader Gyeon Hwon attacked and captured the state of Silla, Wang Kon offered refuge to the deposed Sillan king. In return, the king surrendered his kingdom to Goryeo. In 936 Wang Kon's armies captured Silla and eliminated Gyeon Hwon's son and successor. Korea was united for the first time in recorded history. (It would remain united until at the end of World War II it was once again partitioned.)[PARAGRAPH:2]Wang Kon finally died of disease in 943. History sees him as both an excellent military commander and a skillful statesman who created a nation through a series of clever alliances and decisive military campaigns. Wang Kon's descendants would rule Korea until 1392.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_UNIT_KOREAN_HWACHA_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]The hwacha was an anti-personnel weapon developed by the Koreans, and it is believed to have been one of the first gunpowder-based anti-personnel weapons ever created. The hwacha was a platform constructed to launch large numbers of fire arrows (or "Shin Ki Chon") at enemy targets. Hwachas were mounted on carts and wheelbarrows. A typical hwacha platform held seven or more rows of fifteen arrows and could fire from 150 to 200 fire arrows at once. The fire arrows had hollow tips and the shafts were fitted with narrow pipes. The tips and pipes were filled with gunpowder and each was equipped with a fuse.[PARAGRAPH:1]When lit, the fire arrows' fuses would first ignite the powder in the pipes, causing the arrows to shoot off like rockets. The fuses would continue to burn until they reached the gunpowder in the arrows' heads, which would then explode - with luck, somewhere near enemy soldiers. However, the weapons were extremely inaccurate and the Koreans had to fire off huge volleys to ensure significant damage to their targets.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Shin Ki Chon fire arrows were first developed in Korea and China around 1400 AD, and the hwacha dates from shortly after this period. The fire arrows could travel as far as one kilometer, an amazing range for artillery weapons at that time. Given their famous inaccuracy, the hwacha was best used against massed enemy formations at medium range: even if not precisely on target when they exploded, shrapnel from the fire arrows could still significantly hurt the enemy. Hwacha also were useful shock weapons, due to the noise and light produced by the rocket-like exploding arrows, and even seasoned troops could break and run the first time they encountered the strange new weapon.[PARAGRAPH:1]The best-known use of hwacha historically was during the Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592-98. The Japanese samurai typically advanced in dense groups - easy targets for the hwacha. At the Battle of Haengju, 3400 Koreans were able to defeat 30,000 Japanese with the help of 40 hwacha.[PARAGRAPH:1]The hwacha eventually became obsolete when more efficient metal projectiles (like bullets and artillery shells) replaced the fire arrows.</English>

The B-1B bomber, which went into service in 1986 as a replacement for the B-52, incorporated some of these innovations. The radar signature of the B-1B was reduced to a mere one percent that of the B-52 due to its low cross-section and its minimal use of radar-reflective, hard-edged surfaces.[PARAGRAPH:1]Soon after the B-1B entered service, the U.S. Air Force commissioned Northrop to develop a true stealth bomber as an eventual replacement. First revealed to the public in 1988, the B-2 stealth bomber uses a flying wing design similar in shape to the F-117A stealth fighter. The flying wing design reduces the profile of the B-2 by incorporating its engines into the body of the plane. The engine exhausts and intakes are shielded to prevent infrared tracking. The B-2 also makes use of curved surfaces and radar-absorbing materials to enhance its "invisibility", and make it far less detectable than the B-1B. As of the late 1980s, it was announced that 132 B-2's would be constructed, and would enter service sometime in the 1990s.</English>

He was crowned King of Burgundy at Arles on 30 June 1178. The name Barbarossa came from the northern Italian cities he attempted to rule, and means "red beard". Before his royal election, he was by inheritance Duke of Swabia (1147-1152, as Frederick III). He was the son of Duke Frederick II of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. His mother was Judith, daughter of Henry IX, Duke of Bavaria, from the rival House of Welf, and Frederick therefore descended from Germany's two leading families, making him an acceptable choice for the Empire's prince-electors.[PARAGRAPH:2]He was born in Waiblingen, the son of Frederick II of Hohenstaufen, duke of Swabia, and the nephew of Conrad III, king of Germany. Conrad III, favouring Frederick over his own son, on his deathbed recommended to the German princes that Frederick be chosen for the German kingship and the imperial throne. Accordingly, after the death of his uncle in 1152, Frederick Barbarossa was made German king and elected Holy Roman emperor. He conceived of his imperial title as a grant from God, through the German princes, and wished to restore the glory of the Roman Empire. He consequently decided to consolidate the imperial position in Germany and Italy and began by issuing a general order for peace among the princes of Germany, at the same time granting them extensive concessions. In 1154 he proceeded to Italy, where he received the Lombard crown at Pavia. The following year he was crowned Holy Roman emperor by Pope Adrian IV, whose authority Frederick had reinstated before his coronation.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1156 Pope Adrian aroused Frederick against the papacy by implying in a letter to him that the emperor held lands only as a fief from the pope. Two years later Frederick incurred the hostility of the Lombards by demanding recognition of all his royal rights, including his power to appoint the imperial podesta, or governor, in every town. Such cities as Milan, Piacenza, Brescia, and Cremona considered that demand a denial of their communal liberties and in 1158 began a struggle that lasted until 1183 and required Frederick to lead five expeditions to Italy. Between 1158 and 1162 Frederick warred with Milan and its allies, subduing that city and confirming claims to other Italian cities. Meanwhile Frederick had set up a series of antipopes in opposition to the reigning pope, Alexander III, who supported the cause of the Milanese and their allies and who, in 1165, excommunicated Frederick. By attacking the Leonine City in Rome in 1167-1168, Frederick was able to install one of the antipopes, Paschal III, on the papal throne. The Lombard League, consisting of the cities of Milan, Parma, Padua (Padova), Verona, Piacenza, Bologna, Cremona, Mantua (Mantova), Bergamo, and Brescia, was formed in 1167 and eventually acknowledged Pope Alexander as leader. During the next seven years the league acquired military strength, rebuilt Milan, constructed the fortress city of Alessandria, and organized a federal system of administration. The fifth expedition (1174-1176) of Frederick to Italy terminated in defeat by the Lombard League at Legnano. The defeat was significant in military history, because it was the first major triumph of infantry over a mounted army of feudal knights. Frederick was forced in 1177 to acknowledge Alexander III as pope and in 1183 to sign the Peace of Constance, agreeing to the demands of the Lombards for autonomy but retaining imperial authority over the towns.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although imperial control in Italy was virtually ended by his defeat at Legnano, Frederick managed to enhance his prestige in central Europe. He made Poland tributary to the empire, raised Bohemia to the rank of a kingdom, and erected the margravate of Austria into an independent hereditary duchy. His own power as emperor in Germany was firmly established in 1180, when he ended his long struggle with the Welfs by putting down a revolt led by the Welf Henry the Lion and depriving him of most of his lands.[PARAGRAPH:2]Frederick initiated the Third Crusade in 1189, and in the next year, having resigned the government of the empire to his son Henry, later Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI, set out for Asia Minor.

Born in 603, Pacal I became King of Palenque in 615 and ruled it until his eightieth birthday, dying in 683. During Pacal's youth, the city of Palenque came under continual raids from the neighboring states of Pomona and Calakmul to the south. Palenque's male population was decimated, as men were taken prisoner or sacrificed by the various raiders, leaving Pacal's mother, Lady Sak K'uk, at the reins of the city until Pacal came of age. Taking the throne at the age of twelve, Pacal's reign suffered another decade of raids and even the kidnapping of a noble family member.[PARAGRAPH:2]Several victorious campaigns to subjugate minor city-states would mark the turning point for the young ruler and Pacal gradually found himself in command of a powerful and respected city. Taking revenge on those that once preyed upon his own, Pacal led raids against Pomona, securing his cities hegemony among the Mayans.[PARAGRAPH:2]Once an established power, Pacal began construction of numerous great structures, like the Palace of Palenque, one of the most exceptional examples of Mayan architecture visible today.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite his success in saving his people from the raids of Pomona, Pacal was always looked down upon for inheriting the throne from his mother, rather than from a male predecessor. To combat this, the Mayan ruler engaged in a grand retelling of his Palenque family lineage, proclaiming the divinity of his mother, himself and his son, Kan Balam. This grand history of the Palenque lineage can be seen today lining the walls of the Temple of the Inscription, Pacal's massive burial pyramid. </English>

		<English>[TAB]When discussing "Taoism," one must be careful to distinguish between the philosophy of Tao and the religion of Tao. The philosophy of Tao came first. According to tradition, the philosopher Lao-Tsu lived in the 4th Century BC. He wrote the "Tao Te Ching," which can be roughly translated as "The Book of the Way and its Virtue."[PARAGRAPH:2]The Tao Te Ching is written in verse. It is extremely subtle and difficult to understand. Many scholars have spent years trying to interpret it. The book can be (very primitively and probably inaccurately) summarized as follows: the "Tao" is what exists before everything else. It is formless, and from it all things are formed. Man must aspire to simplicity; only by discarding the useless trappings of culture and civilization can man return to his original state of emptiness - Tao - when all is possible. According to Lao-Tsu, "the sage has no heart of his own" - no intentions, no preconceptions, and no agenda.[PARAGRAPH:2]The religion of Taoism is based upon worship of Lao-Tsu as a deity. According to Taoist religious tradition, in 142 AD Lao-Tsu appeared to Zhang Daoling, a hermit, and told him that the world was coming to an end, and those who followed Lao-Tsu would go on to another, better life. Further, Lao-Tsu's followers would have access to the celestial powers that control the fate of mankind. Zhang preached Lao-Tsu's words and gained many converts.[PARAGRAPH:2]Over time, Taoism split into a number of schools. Some believed that they could change the world through talismans, alchemy, and magical spells. Some sought to achieve immortality through a Buddhist-like enlightenment. A variety of gods from Chinese folklore and Buddhist tradition were incorporated into the religion.[PARAGRAPH:2]Taoism spread widely throughout China, and it was the official state religion for a thousand years, until the end of the Qing Dynasty in 1911. The Communists virtually eradicated the religion in China during the Cultural Revolution (1960-76), when many of the temples were destroyed and the monks and priests sent to "reeducation" camps. In the 1980s China restored some religious tolerance, and Taoist temples are slowly being rebuilt and repaired.[PARAGRAPH:2]It is believed that many Chinese still practice Taoism in some form, despite the government's restrictions. Taoism is also practiced by some 31 million people outside of China, the largest group being in Taiwan. Its influence can be felt world-wide in the practices of acupuncture, herbalism, feng shui, and martial arts. </English>

		<Chinese>在讨论“道”这一名词的时候，必须小心区分作为哲学流派的道家和作为宗教信仰的道教。首先出现的是道家哲学。据记载，哲学家老子生活的年代是公元前四世纪。他的著作就是“道德经”——这一书名的含义大致可以理解为“关于道及其美德的阐述”。[PARAGRAPH:2]道德经是以韵文的形式写成的。用词极其玄妙，非常难懂。无数学者花费了无数的时间尝试解释其中所包含的意义。这部著作的含义可以（极其粗浅和简略地）解释如下：“道”先于天地而生。道无形无象，但创生了宇宙万物。人应当追求无为；只有弃绝所谓的仁义礼智，人类才能回归原本自然，无知无欲的状态，像“道”对待万物那样的无为而治。根据老子的观点，“圣人处无为之事，行不言之教”——不强加意图，不强作判断，不强行干涉。[PARAGRAPH:2]作为一种宗教信仰的道教则将老子奉为神明。根据道教传说，在公元142年，老子降临在一位隐士张道陵的面前，告诉他世界即将面临末日，只有信奉老子的人才能脱离尘世，得道成仙，拥有呼风唤雨，掌控命运的能力。张道陵于是开始宣扬老子的教导，并获得了大批追随者。[PARAGRAPH:2]随着时间的推移，教道中分出了诸多流派。有的流派相信能通过神符，丹药或是咒语控制万物。有的流派则试图通过类似佛教信徒的修行方式求得永生。大量来自中国神话和佛教传说的神灵也逐渐被引入道教的信仰体系。[PARAGRAPH:2]道教在中国各地均相当普及，并被作为官方信仰达上千年之久，直到1911年清朝的灭亡。在文化大革命期间（1966-1976），中国共产党政权实际上完全禁绝了任何宗教信仰，许多道教观宇被拆毁，大批道士被送往“劳改营”。到20世纪80年代，中国政府基本恢复了信仰宽容政策，各地的道观才得以重建和修缮。[PARAGRAPH:2]据认为，虽然政府采取了各种限制措施，但目前在中国仍有许多人信奉着各种流派的道教。道教信徒在中国大陆之外约有3100万人，主要分布于台湾地区。来自于道教的针灸、风水和武术文化已经传遍了整个世界。</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]Grenz infantry or Grenzers were light infantry troops who came from the Croatian and Transylvanian Military Frontier in Habsburg Monarchy (later the Austrian Empire and Austria-Hungary). This borderland formed a buffer zone between Christian Europe and the Ottoman Empire, and the troops were originally raised to defend Austria against the Ottoman Turks. When there was no danger of war against the Ottomans, the Grenzer regiments were employed by the Habsburgs in other theatres of war, although one battalion of each regiment would always remain guarding the border.[PARAGRAPH:2]Grenzers were the successors to the irregular army of Pandurs, which were also raised as a militia by the Habsburgs in the 18th century to defend the border with the Ottomans and also used as skirmishers in the Seven Years' War. However, by the time of the Napoleonic Wars, troops from the Frontier were now formed into more regular line infantry regiments, but were considered by the Austrian generals as something between light and line infantry. They were given training in marksmanship, skirmishing and the basics of linear tactics. At the start of the war, the 18 Grenz infantry regiments formed about a quarter of the Habsburg army.[PARAGRAPH:2]However, the Grenzers were first and foremost skirmishing troops and were thought not to perform as well in the role of line infantry as the regular regiments. As such, many in the Austrian military command did not hold them in much esteem. Following a mutiny in 1800, their numbers were reduced from 57,000 to only 13,000. Despite this, the Grenz infantry performed consistently well in battle, especially at Marengo and Austerlitz, earning them respect from the French. Napoleon held them in high opinion and considered them as the most warlike troops in the entire Austrian army. He had no hesitation in using the Grenz infantry after Austria's defeat in the War of the Fifth Coalition in 1809. The Treaty of Sch&#246;nbrunn compelled Austria to cede territory in the Military Frontier and the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 10th and 11th Grenz Infantry Regiments went into French service. They fought for Napoleon until his defeat and abdication in 1814.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the 19th century, the threat from the Ottoman Turks diminished and there was less need for troops to defend the Frontier. Also, with rise of South Slav nationalism and self-determination, the Austrian high command grew suspicious of the Grenz infantry and a possible uprising. With these factors, the number of Grenz infantry were steadily reduced, although they remained in service in the Austrian and later Austro-Hungarian army until the First World War.</English>

The Industrial Revolution saw the invention of the "Spinning Jenny" and cotton gin, which enabled mass production of cotton-based cloth. After these developments the demand for the plant fiber became almost insatiable, driving up labor demands for its cultivation across the world - leading to, among other things, the continuation of slavery in the United States into the mid-nineteenth century.

		<English>[TAB]Bathing is a common (though not universal) human custom. It is both pleasurable and utilitarian; it ensures that the body is not covered in noxious substances, and is often considered highly relaxing. It can also kill pests and parasites by submersion in water, especially with the addition of various soaps and other chemical substances. In many cultures, bathing also has a spiritual function; ensuring purity of the spirit as well as purity of the body.[PARAGRAPH:2]Primitive societies generally bathe in naturally occurring bodies of water, but this is impractical in a large city. Even if customs permit the level of public undress this would require, there would be too many people making use of the same water supply. Therefore, public, communal bathing systems and bathhouses were a popular and common form of public infrastructure in large cities. Examples of public bathing infrastructure were found in (but not necessarily limited to) the ancient Indus valley, in classical Greece and (famously) Rome, in Japan and the Ottoman Empire, in Indonesia, and in Scandinavia up to the present day.[PARAGRAPH:2]Public (and indeed private) bathing declined in Europe during the Middle Ages due to religious strictures encouraging increased body modesty and condemning bathhouses as sites for prostitution. However, increased awareness of sanitary needs and greater availability of fresh water in the industrial era led to a resurgence, first of publicly available baths that allowed relatively greater privacy than in Roman times, and later of private bathing facilities in every individual home with the rise of indoor plumbing.</English>

Unlike most Carthaginian military units, they were formed entirely of Carthaginian citizens as opposed to the mercenaries who made up the bulk of the Carthaginian army overseas; in fact, they were the only parts of the Carthaginian armies that mercenaries were forbidden to join. The Sacred Band of Astarte was a unit of heavy cavalry, operating in the Hellenistic style. Baal had his own Sacred Band as well, operating as heavy infantry. The skill and experience of these soldiers more than made up for their small numbers, causing historians such as Polybius to describe them as "The shining emblem of Carthage on the battlefield even when there is a host of a hundred thousand men".[PARAGRAPH:2]These soldiers were held as sacred because of the oath they swore when they were accepted in the ranks of the band. Their equipment was also drawn from the temples of the gods, and individual soldiers treated their weapons with honor, feeling they had an obligation to do so. The Sacred Band was easily perceived on a battlefield by wearing white, the color associated with death in Carthaginian society.[PARAGRAPH:2]Tactically, the Sacred Bands relied heavily on mobility and maneuverability, rather than brute strength, making them agile and sophisticated fighters on the battlefield. They were, however, capable of participating in close fighting by locking their shields and spears together into a classical Phalanx formation of spearmen or pikemen, should the tactical situation call for it.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Carthaginian Sacred Bands were eventually defeated during the First Punic War, but were reconstituted by the Carthaginian commander Hannibal Barca prior to Carthage's invasion of the Roman Republic during The Second Punic War.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Great Wall of China is one of the largest and most famous man-made constructions in the entire world. Chinese rulers built the Great Wall to ward off attack from nomadic tribesmen living in modern Manchuria and Mongolia. Interestingly, the Great Wall was not designed to keep the nomads out - the Chinese knew it was all but impossible to defend such a long border - it was designed to make it difficult for the raiders to carry off loot, thus making raids far less profitable and thus less worth the risks involved.[PARAGRAPH:1]There have actually been five different "Great Walls" built by different Chinese dynasties. The first four were constructed of earth and have since all but disappeared. The current wall was built almost entirely by the Ming Dynasty between 1368 and 1640 AD. This wall was constructed on a grander scale, using more permanent materials (like stone). The Ming wall stretches for 3,948 miles from Shanhai Pass on the Bohai Gulf in the east to Lop Nur in the southeast portion of Xinjiang's Uygur Autonomous Region in the west. This was the region where the Silk Road first entered China, and a series of watchtowers which could communicate via smoke signals were intended to pass messages rapidly along the vast length.[PARAGRAPH:1]In pure military terms, the Great Wall turned out to be something of a failure. The Manchus were able to bribe a Chinese general to let them pass through the wall, so it turned out to be of little value in stopping a major barbarian attack. After the Manchus conquered China, the borders of the country extended far to the north, rendering the wall irrelevant. The sheer cost of the wall was also staggering, and the cost in human lives is said to have exceeded over one million souls (the Great Wall is sometimes nicknamed "the long graveyard").[PARAGRAPH:1]Today much of the Great Wall is in a state of disrepair - though the tourist regions are well-preserved, much of the rest of the structure is crumbling, and perhaps only 20%% of the wall is in good condition.

		<Chinese>中国的万里长城是世界上最宏伟、最负盛名的人造工程之一。古代的中国统治者们建造长城，是为了抵御生活在现今东北和蒙古地区游牧部族的入侵。有意思的是，长城的设计并不是为了拒敌于国门之外——中国人明白要全面防御如此漫长的边境线是一项不可能的任务——而是为了使入侵者难以轻易地带着他们的掠获物离开，令劫掠活动能得到的利益不足以弥补需承受的风险。[PARAGRAPH:2]实际上存在着五条不同的“长城”，兴建于五个不同的历史朝代。起初的四座皆以夯土筑成，因此现在已几乎完全湮沒。现存的城墙大都建于公元1368-1640年明朝时期。这条长城建筑规模空前宏大，并采用更为坚固耐久的砖石材料。明长城绵延达3948英里（6352公里），东起渤海之滨的山海关，西至现今新疆维吾尔自治区东南部的罗布泊。（塞爱维小提示：通常认为明长城东起辽东虎山，西至甘肃嘉峪关，全长6350公里。）古丝绸之路从这里开始进入中国本部，长城沿线建有一系列烽火台，能够通过烽火及狼烟高速度长距离的传送信息。[PARAGRAPH:2]从纯军事角度来看，长城可以算是一个失败的工程。满族军队在中国内奸的引导下轻易地越过了她，所以长城在蛮族大举入侵的时代并没有发挥多少作用。满清入主中原之后，中国的疆域大大向北扩展，长城也不再合乎时宜。修建长城所付出的代价也是令人瞠目结舌的，期间牺牲的劳工据说超过了一百万（因此长城有时也被戏称为“最长的墓地”）。[PARAGRAPH:2]在今天，长城大部分都处于年久失修的状态——尽管在一些旅游区保护妥善，但在其他许多地方的长城则正在不断碎裂崩塌，可能仅有20%%的城墙的保护状况尚属理想。虽然状况堪扰，长城仍然是中国最吸引人的游览胜地之一，也是一座真正的世界奇观。[PARAGRAPH:2]</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]The Guptas seem to have relied heavily on infantry archers, and the bow was one of the dominant weapons of their army. The Hindu version of the longbow was composed of metal, or more typically bamboo, and fired a long bamboo cane arrow with a metal head. Unlike the composite bows of Western and Central Asian foes, bows of this design would be less prone to warping in the damp and moist conditions often prevalent to the region. The Indian longbow was reputedly a powerful weapon capable of great range and penetration and provided an effective counter to invading horse archers. Iron shafts were used against armored elephants and fire arrows were also part of the bowmen's arsenal. India historically has had a prominent reputation for its steel weapons. One of these was the steel bow. Due to its high tensility, the steel bow was capable of long range and penetration of exceptionally thick armor. These were less common weapons than the bamboo design and found in the hands of noblemen rather than in the ranks. Archers were frequently protected by infantry equipped with shields, javelins, and longswords.</English>

It was constructed in about 575 BC by order of King Nebuchadnezzar II on the north side of the city.[PARAGRAPH:1]Dedicated to the Babylonian goddess Ishtar, the gate was constructed of blue glazed tiles with alternating rows of bas-relief sirrush (dragons) and aurochs.[PARAGRAPH:1]The roof and doors of the gate were of cedar, according to the dedication plaque. Through the gate ran the Processional Way, which was lined with walls covered in lions on glazed bricks (about 120 of them).[PARAGRAPH:1]Statues of the deities were paraded through the gate and down the Processional Way each year during the New Year's celebration.[PARAGRAPH:1]Originally the gate, being part of the Walls of Babylon, was considered one of the Seven Wonders of the world until, in the 6th century AD, it was replaced by the Lighthouse of Alexandria.[PARAGRAPH:1]A reconstruction of the Ishtar Gate and Processional Way was built at the Pergamon Museum in Berlin out of material excavated by Robert Koldewey and finished in the 1930s. It includes the inscription plaque. It stands 47 feet high and 100 feet wide (14 meters by 30 meters). The excavation ran from 1902-1914, and, during that time, 45 feet of the foundation of the gate was uncovered.[PARAGRAPH:1]The gate was in fact a double gate. The part that is shown in the Pergamon Museum today is only the smaller, frontal part, while the larger, back part was considered too large to fit into the constraints of the structure of the museum. It is in storage.[PARAGRAPH:1]Parts of the gate and lions from the Processional Way are in various other museums around the world. Only three museums acquired dragons, while lions went to several museums. The Istanbul Archaeology Museum has lions, dragons, and bulls. The Detroit Institute of Arts houses a dragon. The R&#246;hsska Museum in Gothenburg, Sweden, has one dragon and one lion; the Louvre, the State Museum of Egyptian Art in Munich, the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Philadelphia, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Oriental Institute in Chicago, the Rhode Island School of Design Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut, each have lions.</English>

The earliest Indian Vedic hymns, the Rigveda, dating from the late 2nd and early 1st millennia BC, make reference to the use of elephants for transport - especially Indra and his divine white elephant, Airavata - but make no reference to the use of elephants in war, focusing instead on Indra's role in leading horse cavalry. The later stories of the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, dating from around the 4th century BC, do however mention elephant warfare, suggesting its introduction during the intervening period. The ancient Indian kings certainly valued the elephant in war, some stating that an army without elephants is as despicable as a forest without a lion, a kingdom without a king or as valour unaided by weapons.</English>

He married a Nepalese and a Chinese princess and was famous for building the Jokhang Temple of Lhasa which still stands today.[PARAGRAPH:2]Songtsen Gampo was the forefather of Buddhism in Tibet. Two generations before King Trisong Detsen invited Shantarakshita and Padmasambhava to Tibet, King Songtsen Gampo cultivated the nation for its transformation, clearing pathways for the dharma to enter and ultimately permeate Tibetan culture. Without Songsten Gampo there would be no Tibetan alphabet, Lhasa would have no Jokang, and the supreme demoness of Central Tibet might still be roaming the earth unfettered.[PARAGRAPH:2]Songtsen Gampo reigned from 617 to 650. His Yarlung dynasty was based in Central Tibet during an imperialist period in Tibetan history. Bon was the dominant religion, and Buddhism was only seminally present. No Tibetan translations of the Buddhist scriptures existed, partially because there was no written form of Tibetan, so Songsten Gampo instructed his minister Thonmi Sambota to travel to India, study Sanskrit, and develop a Tibetan script. He then commissioned the translation of several thousand texts.[PARAGRAPH:2]His celebrated successes in battle expanded the Tibetan empire deep into Nepal and China, and it was during these battles that he gained an appreciation of the neighbouring cultures. As a reminder of the great empire that Songtsen Gampo ruled, a large pillar still stands before the Potala palace in Lhasa, erected during his reign, on which is inscribed the agreement between the Tibetan and Chinese rulers to respect each other's borders. He studied Chinese, became skilled in the art of leadership, and most importantly, he adopted sacred codes of conduct from Buddhist scripture. Under his rule, sacred practices began to replace the shamanistic practices of the Bonpos.[PARAGRAPH:2]Songtsen Gampo's two queens can be credited for a great part of his cultural awareness. Bhirkuti, from Kathmandu, brought the traditions of Himalayan Buddhism. Princess Wengchen, daughter of the Tang emperor, brought a treasure trove of ancient Chinese wisdom. She travelled across the steppes to her husband with a collection of Chinese classic literature and texts on sacred astrology, geomancy, and medicine.[PARAGRAPH:2]Many obstacles lay in Princess Wengchen's path as she headed to Yarlung. She had a vision of a gargantuan demoness who lay sprawled across the Himalayas, so large that one limb lay in Paro, Bhutan and another lay in Western Tibet. When she arrived in Yarlung, she shared her vision with her new husband. Recognizing the value of the treasures that his bride brought to him, as well as the importance of her vision, King Songsten Gampo commissioned thirteen demoness-subjugating temples across the land, built over the demoness's vital organs, ankles, wrists, and torso, forever binding her from wreaking havoc. The Lhasa Jokang was built over her heart center, and Wengchin's Buddha statue was placed inside, where it still resides. Other such temples are Trenduk Lhakhang in Tsetang and Paro Kyichu in Bhutan.[PARAGRAPH:2]King Songtsen Gampo is considered a human emanation of Avalokiteshvara, and he was the grandfather of King Trisong Detsen. Songtsen Gampo meditated for several years in a cave that is now at the core of Potala palace, and is revered for his great patronage of Buddhism.[PARAGRAPH:2]Through his enlightened leadership, the path was cleared for the dharma to be propagated throughout the provinces, and for Buddhism to flourish.</English>

Primarily, the factor that distinguishes wetlands from other land forms or water bodies is the characteristic vegetation of aquatic plants, adapted to its unique hydric soil. Wetlands play a number of roles in the environment, principally water purification, flood control, and shoreline stability. Wetlands are also considered the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as home to a wide range of plant and animal life. Wetlands occur naturally on every continent except Antarctica, the largest including the Amazon River basin, the West Siberian Plain, and the Pantanal. The water found in wetlands can be freshwater, brackish, or saltwater. The main wetland types include swamps, marshes, bogs, and fens; and sub-types include mangrove, carr, pocosin, and varzea. They can also be constructed artificially as a water management tool, which may play a role in the developing field of water-sensitive urban design. The UN Millennium Ecosystem Assessment determined that environmental degradation is more prominent within wetland systems than any other ecosystem on Earth.

When he was 12 he left the uncle who was caring for him and joined his sister in the city of Oaxaca, where he began his formal education. He originally studied for the priesthood, but in 1829 he entered the Oaxaca Institute of Arts and Sciences to study law and science. In 1831 he received his law degree and also won his first public office, a seat on the municipal council. Impeccably honest, he never used public office for personal gain, and his modest way of life reflected his simple tastes even after his marriage in 1843 to Margarita Maza, an Oaxaca girl 17 years younger than he. Politics soon became his life's work: he was a member of both the state and national legislatures, he became a judge in 1841, and he served as governor of his state, a post that brought him into national prominence. During these years in politics Ju&#225;rez began to formulate liberal solutions for his country's many problems. The road to economic health, he concluded, lay in substituting capitalism for the stifling economic monopoly held by the Roman Catholic Church and the landed aristocracy. He also believed that political stability could be achieved only through the adoption of a constitutional form of government based on a federal system.[PARAGRAPH:2] But the return of the conservatives to power in the elections of 1853 doomed imminent reform in Mexico. Many prominent liberals were exiled, including Ju&#225;rez. From December 1853 until June 1855 he lived in New Orleans in the United States in semi poverty, occupying himself by exchanging ideas with other Mexicans and laying plans to return home. The opportunity to put his ideas into action finally came in 1855 when the liberals took control of the national government, and Ju&#225;rez left the United States to join the new administration of Juan &#193;lvarez as minister of justice and public instruction.[PARAGRAPH:2] The liberals carried out three major reforms, all supported by Ju&#225;rez. As minister of justice he was responsible for the law bearing his name that abolished special courts for the clergy and military, for he felt that juridical equality would help promote social equality. In June 1856 the government published the Ley Lerdo ("Lerdo Law," named after the minister of finance). Although it forced the church to sell its property, it contained no threat of confiscation. By breaking up large landed estates, the government hoped that many Mexicans would be able to acquire property and thus create the middle class that it believed was essential for a strong and stable Mexico. The climax of the reform was the liberal constitution promulgated in February 1857. In the same year, Ignacio Comonfort was elected president, and the new Congress chose Ju&#225;rez to preside over the Supreme Court and therefore, according to the constitution, also to serve as the effective vice president of Mexico. The court position was critical in determining his future career, for when the conservatives revolted and ousted Comonfort in January 1858, Ju&#225;rez had a legal claim to the presidency. Lacking troops to control the area around Mexico City, however, he retired to the eastern port city of Veracruz. At Veracruz Ju&#225;rez faced serious difficulties, for he had to create a government and hold it together through quarrels, betrayals, and defeat; to enforce and implement the constitution; to maintain armies in the field and defeat the conservative forces. But he was an extraordinarily tenacious and self-sufficient man, able to concentrate his energy and interest, and he proved himself the master of his government. Because the clergy was supporting the conservatives against the legal government, Ju&#225;rez enacted several laws to curb ecclesiastical power. He nationalized all church property, exempting only those buildings actually used for worship and instruction. To weaken clerical influence still further, he also nationalized the cemeteries and put birth registrations and marriages under the civil authority. Finally, the government separated church and state and guaranteed religious liberty to all citizens.[PARAGRAPH:2] By late 1860 the conservatives were faltering, and in January 1861 Ju&#225;rez was able to return to Mexico City and was constitutionally elected president. He was, however, faced with many serious problems: the opposition's forces still remained intact, the new Congress distrusted its president, and the treasury was virtually empty. As a solution to this latter problem Ju&#225;rez decided in July 1861 to suspend payment on all foreign debts for two years. To safeguard their investments, England, Spain, and France decided to intervene, and by January 1862 the three countries had landed troops at Veracruz. But when Britain and Spain realized that Napoleon III intended to conquer Mexico and control it through a puppet, Archduke Maximilian of Austria, they withdrew their forces. Despite a major defeat at Puebla on May 5, 1862, reinforcements enabled the French to occupy Mexico City in June 1863, and Maximilian soon followed to take control of the government. Forced to leave the capital again, Ju&#225;rez kept himself and his government alive by a long series of retreats that ended only at El Paso del Norte (later named Ciudad Ju&#225;rez) at the Mexican-U.S. border. Early in 1867, as a result of continued Mexican resistance, increased U.S. pressure, and criticism at home, Napoleon decided to withdraw his troops. Soon afterward, Mexican forces captured Maximilian and executed him.[PARAGRAPH:2] Ju&#225;rez then made the greatest mistake of his political career. In August 1867, shortly after his return to Mexico City, he issued a call for national elections and for a referendum on whether Congress should make five amendments to the constitution. Public opinion did not object to the president's running for re-election, but the constitutional changes aroused immediate and violent reaction in many quarters, including those sympathetic to Ju&#225;rez. His proposed changes came under fire because amendments enacted by Congress alone were unconstitutional, and the changes would strengthen the executive power. Ju&#225;rez was re-elected, but the controversy had created such a crisis of confidence that the administration did not even bother to count the votes on the amendments. Despite illness and personal loss&#151;in October 1870 Ju&#225;rez suffered a stroke and three months later his wife died&#151;he decided to run again in 1871. After a bitter campaign he was re-elected, but many of his countrymen, refusing to accept the result as final, took up arms against him. Ju&#225;rez spent the last few months of his life trying to restore peace. He died of a heart attack in 1872.[PARAGRAPH:2] March 21 is a day set to commemorate Juarez.

		<Chinese>[H1]贝尼托&#12539;华雷斯[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Five Times President of Mexico[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]21/3/1806 - 18/7/1872[PARAGRAPH:2:1][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Benito Pablo Juárez García was a Zapotec Amerindian who served five terms as president of Mexico, he was the first Mexican leader who did not have a military background, and also the first full-blooded indigenous national ever to serve as President of Mexico and to lead a country in the Western Hemisphere.[PARAGRAPH:1] Juárez was born of Indian parents, both of whom died when he was three years old. When he was 12 he left the uncle who was caring for him and joined his sister in the city of Oaxaca, where he began his formal education. He originally studied for the priesthood, but in 1829 he entered the Oaxaca Institute of Arts and Sciences to study law and science. In 1831 he received his law degree and also won his first public office, a seat on the municipal council. Impeccably honest, he never used public office for personal gain, and his modest way of life reflected his simple tastes even after his marriage in 1843 to Margarita Maza, an Oaxaca girl 17 years younger than he. Politics soon became his life’s work: he was a member of both the state and national legislatures, he became a judge in 1841, and he served as governor of his state, a post that brought him into national prominence. During these years in politics Juárez began to formulate liberal solutions for his country’s many problems. The road to economic health, he concluded, lay in substituting capitalism for the stifling economic monopoly held by the Roman Catholic Church and the landed aristocracy. He also believed that political stability could be achieved only through the adoption of a constitutional form of government based on a federal system.[PARAGRAPH:1] But the return of the conservatives to power in the elections of 1853 doomed imminent reform in Mexico. Many prominent liberals were exiled, including Juárez. From December 1853 until June 1855 he lived in New Orleans in the United States in semi poverty, occupying himself by exchanging ideas with other Mexicans and laying plans to return home. The opportunity to put his ideas into action finally came in 1855 when the liberals took control of the national government, and Juárez left the United States to join the new administration of Juan álvarez as minister of justice and public instruction.[PARAGRAPH:1] The liberals carried out three major reforms, all supported by Juárez. As minister of justice he was responsible for the law bearing his name that abolished special courts for the clergy and military, for he felt that juridical equality would help promote social equality. In June 1856 the government published the Ley Lerdo ("Lerdo Law," named after the minister of finance). Although it forced the church to sell its property, it contained no threat of confiscation. By breaking up large landed estates, the government hoped that many Mexicans would be able to acquire property and thus create the middle class that it believed was essential for a strong and stable Mexico. The climax of the reform was the liberal constitution promulgated in February 1857. In the same year, Ignacio Comonfort was elected president, and the new Congress chose Juárez to preside over the Supreme Court and therefore, according to the constitution, also to serve as the effective vice president of Mexico.

To weaken clerical influence still further, he also nationalized the cemeteries and put birth registrations and marriages under the civil authority. Finally, the government separated church and state and guaranteed religious liberty to all citizens.

		<English>[TAB]Originally consigned to the pages of science fiction, the concept of a "space elevator" has begun to attract serious attention in the halls of academia and the space industry itself. The space elevator is a system for cheaply hauling goods and material into space. Once completed, it would quickly replace the current wasteful method of carrying everything up in dangerous and very expensive rockets.[PARAGRAPH:1]The basic concept is simple; a satellite in geosynchronous orbit is connected by cable to a stationery or mobile platform somewhere on Earth's equator. An elevator, or "climber", would ride up and down the cable at a fraction of present costs.[PARAGRAPH:1]There are a number of problems that need to be overcome before such a project could be put in place. For one, the cable would have to be made of a material stronger and lighter than anything yet known. At the moment, carbon nanotubes seem to be the best candidate, but nobody knows how to construct them in quantity, nor yet how to weave them into cable. And even these might not be strong or light enough.[PARAGRAPH:1]However, when considering the many daunting scientific and engineer challenges facing the project, it is quite useful to remember that a far less advanced world figured out how to put a man on the moon a mere ten years after it was first seriously proposed. Many sane and sober people believe that a space elevator will be constructed within this century.</English>

		<English>[TAB]According to Jewish tradition, Solomon's Temple was the first Jewish temple in Jerusalem, and, as the "dwelling place of God," the single most important building in the Jewish religion. Construction was begun by King David and completed by his son, Solomon. The temple was built by Phoenician workers using the finest materials available - stones quarried from beneath the city, wood from Lebanon, and 3000 tons of gold and 30,000 tons of silver. The result was an astonishingly beautiful edifice standing some 30 yards long by 10 yards wide by 16 yards in height. It took seven years to complete the Temple.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Temple consisted of three main rooms surrounded by smaller chambers. Upon climbing a set of stairs, the visitor would enter the vestibule, which was topped with two enormous pillars given the names of Jachin and Boaz. From there the visitor would proceed into the "Greater House" or "Holy Place," wherein important religious services were performed. Beyond the Greater House lay the "Holy of Holies," a square, cedar-lined room which held the "Ark of the Covenant." The Ark of the Covenant was a sacred container which held the stone tablets upon which were written the Ten Commandments, given by God to Moses. The building was surrounded by a courtyard in which the people worshipped.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Temple was pillaged many times over the years, and it was finally looted and burned to the ground by King Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon some time around 580 BC, during the time of the "Babylonian Captivity." Years later, many of the Temple's treasures were returned to the Jews by King Cyrus of Persia, but the Ark was missing. Some believe that the Ark was removed and hidden before the Babylonian attack, while others believe that the Ark was captured by Babylon and then destroyed or lost. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church claims to possess the Ark, it having been brought there by one of Solomon's sons. In any case, the destruction of the Temple was total, and there is much controversy and debate about where it originally stood.[PARAGRAPH:1]The "Second Temple" was constructed in Jerusalem in approximately 500 BC. It in turn was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD. All that remains of this building is the "Western Wall," also known as the "Wailing Wall."</English>

It appears as if the first stone tools were used by Paranthropus, an ancestor of man who lived about two million years ago.[PARAGRAPH:1]Most stone tools are created by chipping or grinding. The former is used when working with crystalline materials such as flint, chert and obsidian. The worker taps the stone with a harder stone, carefully chipping off stone flakes until the stone has been properly shaped. Mesoamerican tribes used this method to make their sharp and deadly obsidian swords.[PARAGRAPH:1]The grinding method is used when working with harder and coarser materials such as basalt and granite. This is a long and tedious process in which the toolmaker repeatedly grinds away the stone with a harder material or with sand, sometimes using water as a lubricant. Many of the earliest European stone axes were made using this process.</English>

		<English>[TAB]An administrative center is a seat of regional administration or local government, or a county town, or the place where the central administration of a commune is located. Local Government is a form of public administration which in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions.[PARAGRAPH:1]The question of municipal autonomy is a key question of public administration and governance. The institutions of local government vary greatly between countries, and even where similar arrangements exist, the terminology often varies. Common names for local government entities include state, province, region, department, county, prefecture, district, city, township, town, borough, parish, municipality, shire, village, and local service district.</English>

Ivan managed countless changes in the progression from a medieval state to an empire and emerging regional power, and became the first ruler to be crowned as Tsar of All the Russias.[PARAGRAPH:2]Historic sources present disparate accounts of Ivan's complex personality: he was described as intelligent and devout, yet given to rages and prone to episodic outbreaks of mental illness, that increased with his age, affecting his reign. In one such outburst, he killed his groomed and chosen heir Ivan Ivanovich. This left the Tsardom to be passed to Ivan's younger son, the weak and intellectually disabled Feodor Ivanovich.[PARAGRAPH:2]Ivan's legacy is complex: he was an able diplomat, a patron of arts and trade, founder of the Moscow Print Yard, Russia's first publishing house, a leader highly popular among the common people of Russia, but he is also remembered for his paranoia and arguably harsh treatment of the Russian nobility. The Massacre of Novgorod is regarded as one of the biggest demonstrations of his mental instability and brutality.</English>

The land routes were supplemented by sea routes which extended from the Red Sea to East Africa, India, China, and Southeast Asia. China traded silk, spices, teas, and porcelain; while India traded ivory, textiles, precious stones, and pepper; and the Roman Empire exported gold, silver, fine glassware, wine, carpets, and jewels.[PARAGRAPH:1]In recent years, both the maritime and overland Silk Routes are again being used, often closely following the ancient routes.[PARAGRAPH:1]Going back nearly 2000 years, during China's Eastern Han Dynasty, a sea route, although not part of the formal Silk Route, led from the mouth of the Red River near modern Hanoi, through the Malacca Straits to Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka and India, and then on to the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea kingdom of Axum and eventually to Roman ports. From ports on the Red Sea, goods, including silks, were transported overland to the Nile and then to Alexandria from where they were shipped to Rome, Constantinople and other Mediterranean ports.[PARAGRAPH:1]Another branch of these sea routes led down the East African coast, called "Azania " by the Greeks and Romans in the 1st century AD, as described in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (and, very probably, Zesan in the 3rd century by the Chinese), at least as far as the port known to the Romans as "Rhapta," which was probably located in the delta of the Rufiji River in modern Tanzania.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Silk Road extends from Guangzhou, located in southern China, to present day Brunei, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Malacca, Ceylon, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Iran and Iraq. In Europe it extends from Israel, Lebanon (Collectively, the Levant), Egypt, and Italy (historically, Venice) in the Mediterranean Sea to other European ports or caravan routes such as the great Hanseatic League fairs via the Spanish road and other Alpine routes.

While not poor, Lincoln certainly had more in common with the average American than his more affluent political counterparts. An almost entirely self-made man, Lincoln's formal education included only 18 months of unofficial schooling which he supplemented with his own studies. Teaching himself law, he was admitted to the bar in 1837 upon which he became a well known and successful lawyer.[PARAGRAPH:2]Lincoln is best known for his Emancipation Proclamation, which declared the end to slavery in the United States, and his refusal to permit the secession of the South. His reasons for fighting the Civil War are often misconstrued, however, as being motivated by his desire to end slavery. Lincoln's motivations behind fighting the civil war were the preservation of the Union and, to an extent, the protection of the larger democratic ideals represented by an unshattered  Union. "[A]nd that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth." (Gettysburg Address)[PARAGRAPH:2]Few public speakers in American history have spoken in a manner that at once appealed to the desires of their constituents while at the same time addressed the larger issues outside the purview of an average citizen. This was Lincoln's gift. A brilliant orator and public speaker, he was able to convey the larger political picture to his constituents in a way that was at once easy to understand and implored action for the greater good of the country.[PARAGRAPH:2]Largely criticized and ridiculed for his policies before and during the war, Lincoln's greatness was only fully acknowledged by the public after his assassination by John Wilkes Booth on April 15th, 1865.</English>

Originally developed in the 14th century, firearms evolved quickly, and by the late 17th century flintlock muskets had become commonplace in battle. Musketmen, who were relatively inexpensive to equip and train, proved a deadly foe for the knights who had dominated the battlefield for so many years. Armies were often comprised of a combination of musketmen, cannon, and knights, each complementing the strengths and weaknesses of the others. Large forces of musketmen within a fortress or behind city walls proved an exceedingly difficult obstacle to an attacking army.

		<English>[TAB]The Oromo are a cultural group that has lived for centuries in the area today known as Ethiopia. Historically defined by their unique democratic caste system, each age group within the Oromo was assigned to a specific position within society. As an Oromo citizen aged, they progressed through these age groupings to assume different positions within the Oromo hierarchy. Young men between the ages of sixteen and thirty-two were traditionally assigned to the warrior caste. Young Oromo men were not fully considered men until they had killed a man or, in times of peace, a fierce animal.[PARAGRAPH:1]Bravery in combat was paramount among Oromo culture, and many of their customs required retelling the histories of great warriors. These storytelling traditions reinforced the warlike attitude prevalent throughout Oromo society. In addition to this focus on military achievement, the Oromo also heavily stressed the importance of harmony and peace amongst their people. This unifying ideal ensured that if any outside military force attacked an Oromo tribe, they could expect a united Oromo counterattack. </English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_CIV_HOLY_ROMAN_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]The Holy Roman Empire was created in 800 AD by Charlemagne. Covering much of central Europe from the Netherlands to Hungary, the Empire was both a political powerhouse and a hotbed of political intrigue and military conflict. In some ways "Emperors" in name only, the rulers of the Holy Roman Empire were rarely able to exert real control over any territory that was beyond the reach of their personal armies.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although the Holy Roman Empire was not referred to as such until late in the reign of Otto I (962-973), it came into being as a political entity in 800 AD when Pope Leo III, in an effort to break ties with the weakening Byzantine Empire, crowned Charlemagne the "Emperor of the Romans." A keen military strategist and devout Catholic, Charlemagne managed to keep the empire united until his death in 814, upon which the empire steadily dissolved into separate warring states until reunited under the rule of Otto I. While Otto I managed to reunite the empire, his downfall, and that of many successor emperors, was his fixation on Italy. Although Italy was not formally part of the empire, Otto I repeatedly invaded that country in order to secure holdings for the Germanic empire. However, the majority of his military ventures into Italy were unsuccessful, and Otto I only succeeded in eroding his power base in Germany.[PARAGRAPH:2]Throughout its history, the Holy Roman Empire was the stage for conflicts between its Emperors and the Church. Initially it was only the Pope who could designate the Roman Emperor, however over time - especially during the reign of Otto I - it became instead the Emperor who named the next Pope, providing the throne with enormous religious power. During the reign of the Salian Emperors (1024-1125) this practice again changed. A council of churchmen, known as Cardinals, was formed and given the power to nominate and elect popes. This practice has continued with only minor changes to the present day.[PARAGRAPH:2]Charles VI ruled with perhaps the most pragmatic view of his empire. Voted by the Cardinal Council as Holy Roman Emperor in 1355, Charles immediately gave up all imperial ambitions in Italy and instead focused on consolidating power in the Germanic lands and the eastern half of his empire. Accepting that the German cities and territories were the political and military domains of their local rulers, Charles worked with these local leaders to establish a combined dominance instead of attempting to wrest away their power. Unfortunately, upon Charles' death his son Sigismund fell back into the historical fallacy of attempting to control Italy, and the Empire once again continued its decline into irrelevancy.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite the internal power struggles wracking the Holy Roman Empire, local rulers banded together in order to face the Napoleonic threat from France. From 1792 to 1802, Austria, Prussia and the other German states combined forces with the hope of defeating the invading French, but to no avail. With little territory left under his control, Emperor Francis II resigned the title of Holy Roman Emperor. The Empire was formally dissolved on the sixth of August, 1806.[PARAGRAPH:2]Over its history, the Holy Roman Empire existed more as an idea than an actual administrative organization. The empire's leaders rarely had actual control over their lands, and constant squabbling between fiefdom holders, as well as the church and state, kept the empire from solidifying any real control over its domain. Its recreation has, however, served as a goal which many would-be conquerors in history have strived to achieve, including Otto von Bismark, King William I, and Adolf Hitler.</English>

		<Chinese>[BOLD]策略提示:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]神圣罗马文明是其对手们在中古时代的梦魇。神圣罗马替代法庭的特色建筑——议会厅可将城市维护费降低百分之七十五，使其几乎不必受维护费问题的困扰。而神圣罗马替代长枪兵的特色单位——自由佣兵可以说是中古时代最强的肉搏兵种，对其他肉搏单位及骑乘单位作战时均拥有百分之百的奖励加成。帝国领袖查理曼的特质是“保国”加“霸权”，擅长建立并维持庞大的领土，使得神圣罗马帝国成为游戏中最强大的文明之一。[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]背景:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]“神圣罗马帝国”是在公元800年时由查理曼所创立。帝国的传统疆域西起尼德兰，东达匈牙利，覆盖了中欧大部分地区，它既是改变欧洲历史之走向的强大实体，又是滋生阴谋和冲突的政治温床。从某种意义上来说，“神圣罗马皇帝”仅是这个庞大帝国名义上的最高统治者，历代皇帝往往只能调遣数量有限的军队，掌控范围有限的土地。[PARAGRAPH:1]虽然神圣罗马帝国上述地理疆域和形态特征是直到奥托一世统治时期（962-973）才真正成形的，但其作为一个政治实体的历史则开始于公元800年，当时罗马教皇利奥三世为了孤立业已衰落的拜占庭帝国（“东罗马帝国”），加冕查理曼为“神圣罗马皇帝”（塞爱维小提示：许多历史学家将这个政权称为“查理曼帝国”或“法兰克帝国”以同后来只包括中欧地区的“神圣罗马帝国”相区别）。查理曼是一位杰出的军事战略家和虔诚的天主教徒，他使帝国保持统一状态，但当他于公元814年去世后，帝国迅速分裂为几个彼此征战的邦国，直到奥托一世再次完成统一。虽然奥托一世成功重建了帝国，但他和他的继任者们都在对意大利的执意征伐中吃了苦头。意大利在当时已不属于帝国的正式版图（虽然查理曼曾对其实施有效的控制），可是为了壮大这个日耳曼帝国的实力，奥托一世不断率军南侵。奥托一世在意大利的军事冒险毫无收获，反而削弱了他在日耳曼地区的权力基础。[PARAGRAPH:1]皇帝与教会之间的争斗贯穿了神圣罗马帝国的整个历史。起初，只有教皇才能为皇帝加冕，然而随着时间的推移——特别是在奥托一世统治时期——反而是由皇帝来任命教皇，皇帝集世俗和宗教权力于一身。在萨利安王朝时期（1024-1125）情况再次改变，由教会人员组成的“红衣主教团”（Cardinals）掌握了提名和选举教皇的权力。这一制度经历微小调整，一直延续至今。[PARAGRAPH:1]查理六世也许是帝国历史上最为务实的一位皇帝。1355年查理六世经由红衣主教团推举成为皇帝之后，立即宣布放弃对意大利的领土要求，专注于巩固对日耳曼地区和帝国东半部分的控制。查理六世允许日耳曼地方诸侯在各自所属城市和领地上实施政治和军事统治，同他们分享帝国的利益，而不是图谋剥夺他们的权力。不幸的是，查理六世死后，他的儿子西吉斯蒙德又开始重复尝试控制意大利的错误，帝国也再度陷入历史潮流的对立面。[PARAGRAPH:1]尽管后期的神圣罗马帝国饱受内乱的困扰，但诸侯们还是团结起来，共同对抗法国皇帝拿破仑的威胁。从1792年到1802年，奥地利、普鲁士和其他日耳曼邦国怀着击退法国入侵的希望结成联盟共同战斗，但却屡遭挫败。眼看领地已经所剩无几，最后一任皇帝弗朗茨二世被迫退位。1806年8月6日，帝国正式宣告解体。[PARAGRAPH:1]历史上的“神圣罗马帝国”在大多数时候都只是一个名不副实的虚幻理想，皇帝很少能够真正掌控归属在其名下的疆土，总是不断与封臣、教会和城邦进行着明争暗斗，使其对帝国的有效统治变成不可能的任务。重建这个欧洲大帝国成为后世许多征服者追求的目标，包括奥托·冯·俾斯麦，包括威廉一世，也包括阿道夫·希特勒。</Chinese>

		<English>[H1]Otto von Bismarck[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Chancellor of Germany[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1815 - 1898 AD[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Otto von Bismarck, also known as the "Iron Chancellor," is perhaps the most significant figure in German history. During his long political career, Bismarck unified Germany and founded the German Empire. During his 30-year chancellorship, Germany was transformed from a weak and loose confederation of states into a powerful united country that would come to dominate continental Europe.[PARAGRAPH:2]Descended of a noble Prussian family, Bismarck certainly inherited the arrogance of the Prussian Junker class. He was a poor student who excelled at dueling and was quite a historian and linguist. However, he spent much of his time drinking with the other aristocrats in their exclusive fraternity.[PARAGRAPH:2]Unable to accept the discipline required for military service, Bismarck instead entered the Prussian diplomatic corps, where his skill quickly brought him to the attention of the Prussian Kaiser. Appointed to the German Federal Diet (congress), Bismarck worked to increase Prussian status and power within Germany. Eventually he would rise to the rank of Prussian Prime Minister, where after years of long struggle, he succeeded in unifying Germany under Prussian rule. Bismarck would accomplish this through crafty diplomacy, aided by a series of successful wars.[PARAGRAPH:2]Once Germany was unified, Bismarck's main foreign policy aim was to keep the peace in Europe, mostly by isolating France, Germany's historic enemy. In this he was largely successful. He engineered a war with France in 1870 in order to draw several German states (Bavaria, Baden, and others) into the German empire. In the war, France was quickly defeated.[PARAGRAPH:2]Having achieved his objective of acquiring the German states, Bismarck argued for fairly lenient terms, but the German people and military wanted more, and he was forced to annex the French provinces of Alsace and Loraine. Bismarck knew that this would be trouble in the long run - before the war he had told a colleague, "Supposing we did win Alsace, we would have to maintain our conquest and to keep Strasbourg perpetually garrisoned. This would be an impossible position, for in the end the French would find new allies - and we might have a bad time." This, of course, is exactly what happened in World War I, where Germany had a very bad time indeed.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although an ardent conservative and monarchist, Bismarck was the first European leader to promote a system of social security for workers. He rebuilt the German monetary system, introducing for the first time a single currency. He also helped fabricate the new country's code of civil and commercial law. His benevolence was not universal, however; while emancipating the Jews, Bismarck also enacted laws aimed at restraining Germany's Catholics.[PARAGRAPH:2]As a diplomat, Bismarck's greatest weakness was his single-minded desire to weaken France. He was largely successful during his lifetime, but in doing so he made France into an implacable enemy, which would have dire consequences in the next century. Domestically, Bismarck's great flaw was his indifference to the lives of the German people. As Germany grew in power and stature, the people's lives improved but little. His social security system did some good, but he enacted that mainly to avoid having to make greater concessions to the German Socialists.[PARAGRAPH:2]In total, Bismarck was a great leader, perhaps the greatest European leader of the 19th Century. His triumphs greatly outweighed his defeats, and he almost single-handedly turned a group of bickering kingdoms in to a mighty state. The disasters in Germany's future were not so much a result of his policies, but of his successors' inability to adjust to the changing geopolitical climate in Europe.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_CIV_HARAPPANS_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]The earliest traces of civilization in the Indian subcontinent can be found along the Indus River. The first excavations of this Indus Valley Civilization, or Harappan Civilization, were conducted in 1921 in the ancient cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro. Both of these sites show examples of a highly sophisticated civilization that first developed some 4,500 - 5,000 years ago. The Indus Valley people were most likely Dravidians, who may have been pushed down into southern India when the Aryans, with their more advanced military technology, commenced their migrations to India around 2,000 BC. Though the Indus Valley script has yet to be deciphered, the numerous seals, statuary, potter, and cities of the Indus Valley have enabled scholars to construct a realistic account of the Indus Valley Civilization.[PARAGRAPH:2] A centralized state and extensive town planning is suggested by the layout of the great cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro. The same kind of burnt brick appears to have been used in many cities that were hundreds of miles apart. The weights and measures show a substantial regularity. The Indus Valley people domesticated animals and harvested various crops, such as cotton, sesame, peas, and barley. They may also have been seafaring people, as Indus Valley seals have been found in places such as Sumer. However, the Indus Valley Civilization appears to have been extensively urban, challenging the former idea of India as an agricultural civilization. The Indus Valley people had a merchant class that, as data suggests, engaged in widespread trading.[PARAGRAPH:2]Neither Harappa nor Mohenjo-Daro show any evidence of fire altars, and as a result one can reasonably surmise that the various rituals around the fire which are important in Hinduism were brought in by the Aryans. The Indus Valley people do not appear to have been in ownership of horses, as Harappan seals and terracotta do not show any evidence of horses. Other than the excavated ruins of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, these seals provide the most detailed hints on the personality and culture of the Indus Valley people. Bulls and elephants do appear on the seals, yet the horned bulls still cannot be associated with Shiva's bull in Hinduism. The revered cow of Hinduism also does not appear on the Harappan seals. The women portrayed on the seals wear elaborate clothing in heavy jewelry. This suggests that the Indus Valley people were sophisticated people with cultured tastes in an advanced artistic feeling.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Indus Valley civilization raises many unresolved questions. Why did this civilization, considering its sophistication, not spread beyond the Indus Valley? The area where the Indus Valley Civilization developed is arid, and one can surmise that urban development took place along a river that flowed through a virtual desert. There are also question about the disappearance of the Indus Valley cities. In the Rig Veda there is mention of a Vedic war god, Indra, destroying some forts and citadels, which could have included Harappa and other Indus Valley cities. However, most of the evidence concerning the cities' disappearance is based on the arrival of the Aryans in India.</English>

Designed by Catalan architect Antoni Gaud&#237; (1852-1926), his work on the building is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In November 2010, Pope Benedict XVI consecrated the church and proclaimed it a minor basilica.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1882, construction of Sagrada Fam&#237;lia began under architect Francisco de Paula del Villar. In 1883, when Villar resigned, Gaud&#237; took over as chief architect, transforming the project with his architectural and engineering style, combining Gothic and curvilinear Art Nouveau forms. Gaud&#237; devoted the remainder of his life to the project, and he is buried in the crypt. At the time of his death at age 73 in 1926, when he was run down by a tram, less than a quarter of the project was complete.[PARAGRAPH:2]Relying solely on private donations, Sagrada Familia's construction progressed slowly and was interrupted by the Spanish Civil War. In July 1936, revolutionaries set fire to the crypt and broke their way into the workshop, partially destroying Gaud&#237;'s original plans, drawings and plaster models, which led to 16 years work to piece together the fragments of the master model. Construction resumed to intermittent progress in the 1950s. Advancements in technologies such as computer aided design and computerised numerical control (CNC) have since enabled faster progress and construction past the midpoint in 2010. However, some of the project's greatest challenges remain, including the construction of ten more spires, each symbolising an important Biblical figure in the New Testament.

Large waka, such as Nga Toki Matawhaorua which are usually elaborately carved and decorated, consist of a main hull formed from a single hollowed-out log, along with a carved upright head and tailboard. The gunwale is raised in some by a continuous plank which gives increased freeboard and prevents distortion of the main hull components when used in a rough seas. Sometimes the hull is further strengthened, as in the case of Te Winika, a 200-year-old design, by a batten or stringer running lengthwise both inside and outside the hull just above the loaded waterline. The resurgence of Maori culture has seen an increase in the numbers of waka taua built, generally on behalf of a tribal group, for use on ceremonial occasions.[PARAGRAPH:1]Traditionally the war canoe was highly tapu. No cooked food was allowed in the craft and the waka had to be entered over the gunwales,not the bow or stern which were highly decorated with powerful symbols. Canoes were often painted with black or white with black representing death. The main color was red which stood for tapu. Sometimes a waka would be placed upright as a marker for a dead chief with the curved bottom of the hull carved. Maori told missionaries during the Musket wars that battles between waka took place at sea with the aim being to ram an enemy's waka amidships at high speed. The ramming vessel would ride up over the gunwale and either force it under water or cause it to roll over. The enemies were either killed, left to drown or captured to be used in cannibal feasts or as slaves if they were female. This description matches the attack on the ship's boat of Abel Tasman in Golden Bay in 1642 when a Maori catamaran rammed a cock boat and 4 Dutch sailors were killed.</English>

The Mali Empire was located on the Mandinka plateau in West Africa, located in the southern part of the modern Republic of Mali. It was founded by Sundiata Keita, a Mandinka who led a revolt against the Soso Kingdom which had dominated the area. Sundiata's life is commemorated in the Epic of Sundiata, a poem of the Mandinka people. It is said that after his victory over the Soso, Sundiata Keita converted to Islam as a gesture of goodwill to the Islamic traders who brought his country wealth. After defeating the Soso, Sundiata pursued an expansionist policy, and soon the Empire covered not only modern Mali, but also extended west to the ocean across what is now Senegal. During war, the Mali often fought as "skirmishers" - soldiers who fanned out in loose formation to protect the main force's flanks or front. The Mali skirmishers were lightly-armed archers in that force, famed for their courage and their marksmanship.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Mali Empire reached its zenith under the rule of Mansa Musa (1312-1337) in the early 14th century. Previously, it had been part of the empire of Ghana, which flourished between the seventh and 11th centuries based on the trade of gold from the interior for salt from the coastal regions. Mansa Musa made a famous pilgrimage to Mecca in 1324 laden with gold and slaves to proclaim Mali's prosperity and power. It is said that he lavished so much wealth along his route that the price of gold was depressed for years afterwards. During Mansa Musa's rule Muslim scholarship reached new heights in Mali, and such cities as Timbuktu and Djenn&#233; (Jenne) became important centers of trade, learning, and culture.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the decline of the Mali Empire, the territory became part of the Songhai Empire, which occupied an area covering parts of modern-day Guinea, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Nigeria. Songhai was brought to an end and its territory usurped by the Moroccan invasion of 1591. With the decline of the trans-Saharan trading routes in favor of naval commerce, the area enjoyed little strategic importance and was divided into small kingdoms for the next two centuries until the arrival of French colonists. Mali was absorbed into French West Africa in 1895. In 1960, together with what is now Senegal, it achieved independence as the Federation of Mali, although Senegal seceded after a few weeks. </English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_UNIT_CRUISER_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]For centuries, "cruiser" existed as a mission designation- a 'cruiser' was a ship that cruised long distances on independent patrol, searching for the enemy or engaging in commerce warfare. This role typically fell upon sloops frigates, which were less heavily burdened than the massive ships of the line and thus better suited to long range independent operations. The frigates of the Age of Sail survived in recognizable form up through the mid-19th century. Auxiliary wood or coal-fired steam engines appeared to give the ship better mobility than sail alone could offer, but the basic design remained constant.[PARAGRAPH:2]The superiority of ironclads over wooden-hulled ships forced a redesign of this intermediate-sized warship. Early ironclads were short-ranged and unseaworthy; in the 1870s steam propulsion had matured to the point where a fast ship could be provided with a useful armor belt to protect it from enemy cannon fire. This gave rise to the "armored cruiser," usually tipping the scales at five to ten thousand tons, powerful enough to fight alongside the largest warships, but sacrificing some of a heavier battleship's firepower in exchange for speed.[PARAGRAPH:2]Early armored cruisers adopted the basic 'citadel' concept of other ironclads: a well-armored box covered the ship's steam engines, ammunition storage, and main guns. The main difference between cruisers and battleships was the cruiser's relatively smaller size and lighter weapons, along with a hull designed to allow for higher speed. Armored cruisers and battleships of the same generation usually had roughly the same layout because of this.[PARAGRAPH:2]At the beginning of the period, the norm was to equip ships with a small number of powerful broadside guns, with a few very heavy guns forward and aft. Over time, this gave way to lighter broadside guns (mostly meant to engage relatively small, poorly armored opponents) and two to four heavy guns mounted in turrets at the front and back ends of the 'box.' This arrangement was common among cruisers and battleships throughout the last third of the 19th century and into the early 20th.[PARAGRAPH:2]However, armored cruisers might be fast, but they were usually short ranged. For a time, unarmored cruisers soldiered on for long-range operations in colonial waters. In the 1880s the invention of lighter but stronger steel armor allowed these ships to be replaced by "protected cruisers" of two to five thousand tons. A protected cruiser had much less armor than a true 'armored' cruiser, but at least provided a solid deck that would prevent enemy fire from penetrating the ship's engine compartments and ammunition storage.[PARAGRAPH:2]These ships were mainly powered by steam, but had a limited backup sailing rig in case of engine failure, or for operations far from a coaling depot. As the 19th century closed, the backup sailing rigs began to lose popularity in favor of all-steam propulsion. However, a limited sailing rig can still be seen on some 1890s-vintage protected cruisers such as USS Olympia, which was preserved as a museum ship after serving as the American flagship at the Battle of Manila Bay.[PARAGRAPH:2]Moving into the 20th century, the 'broadside' armament concept was abandoned entirely, replaced by the idea of putting all a ship's main guns in turrets in a line along the length of the ship. This left much more room for the heaviest guns. Battleships built according to this principle are famously known as 'dreadnoughts;' the same changes affected cruisers.[PARAGRAPH:2]Armored cruisers evolved into 'battlecruisers:' fast ships with guns roughly the same size as those used by battleships of the same generation, but with thinner armor; battlecruisers tended to resemble battleships closely and often performed the same missions. Advances in engine technology and the gradual increase of ship tonnage allowed protected cruisers to carry stronger armor belts in addition to their decks, and to protect more of the ship; protected cruisers evolved into what later became known as "heavy" and "light" cruisers.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the World Wars, typical speed for a cruiser was around 30 knots (~55 km/h); main armament for a battlecruiser would be heavy naval artillery of around 15" caliber (~38 cm), while more ordinary cruisers limited themselves to a more numerous battery of 6" or 8" (15-20 cm) guns.[PARAGRAPH:2]The cruiser's missions of raiding, scouting, and escort duty stayed more or less unchanged, although battlecruisers were often drawn into intense combat between battleships even though their thinner armor protection made them dangerously vulnerable to enemy heavy guns as illustrated by the unfortunately named HMS Invincible, which was blown apart and sunk in less than two minutes at the Battle of Jutland.[PARAGRAPH:2]After World War Two, the cruiser, like all warships, saw major changes in design as advances in air power and missile technology made heavy naval artillery obsolete.</English>

		<Chinese>[表]几个世纪以来，“巡洋舰”作为一种任务名称而存在，“巡洋舰”是一种在独立巡逻、搜寻敌人或从事商业战中进行长途巡洋舰。这种角色通常落在单桅护卫舰上，它们的负担比这条航线上的大型舰艇轻，因此更适合远程独立作战。风帆时代的护卫舰在19世纪中叶以可辨认的形式幸存下来。辅助的木材或燃煤蒸汽发动机似乎给船只比单独航行提供更好的流动性，但基本设计保持不变。[段落：2 ]铁皮船上的铁甲的优越性迫使这艘中型舰船重新设计。早期的铁甲是短程的，不适合使用；在19世纪70年代，蒸汽推进技术已经成熟到可以为快艇提供有用的装甲带，以保护其免受敌人炮火的攻击。这就产生了“装甲巡洋舰”，通常在5到1万吨的重量下倾斜，其威力足以与最大的战舰并肩作战，但是牺牲一些较重的战舰火力来换取速度。[段：2 ]早期装甲巡洋舰采用了其他铁甲的基本堡垒概念：一个装甲箱，覆盖了舰船的蒸汽引擎、弹药库和主炮。巡洋舰和战列舰的主要区别在于巡洋舰相对较小的尺寸和较轻的武器，以及设计用于提高速度的船体。同一代装甲巡洋舰和战舰通常具有大致相同的布局。（段：2）在该时期开始时，标准是装备少量的强大的舷侧炮，随着时间的推移，一些非常重的炮火向前推进。这就让位给较轻的舷侧炮（主要是用来对付相对较小的、装甲不太好的对手）和装在炮塔前端和后端的两个到四个重炮。这种安排在十九世纪和第二十年初的第三个巡洋舰和战列舰中是常见的。装甲巡洋舰可能速度很快，但通常是短程的。有一段时间，非装甲巡洋舰在殖民地水域进行远程作战。在19世纪80年代，发明了更轻但更坚固的钢制装甲，使得这些船只被2000吨到5000吨的“保护巡洋舰”所取代。一艘受保护的巡洋舰比真正的“装甲巡洋舰”装甲少得多，但至少提供了一个坚固的甲板，可以防止敌人的火势穿透船只的引擎舱和弹药库。[第2段]这些船只主要是由蒸汽驱动的，但在发动机失灵的情况下，只有有限的备用帆船装备。或者在远离煤炭仓库的地方。随着19世纪的结束，备用的帆船平台开始逐渐失去人气，转而采用全蒸汽推进。然而，在一些19世纪90年代的旧有保护巡洋舰，如美国奥林匹亚号战舰上，仍能看到一艘有限的帆船，它在马尼拉湾战役中作为美国旗舰被保存为博物馆船。[段：2 ]进入二十世纪，“舷侧”武器概念被完全抛弃，取而代之的是把船上所有的主炮放在炮塔里，沿着船的长度排成一行。这给最重的枪留下了更大的空间。根据这一原理建造的战舰被称为“无畏舰艇”，同样的变化也影响了巡洋舰。[段：2 ]装甲巡洋舰演变成“战舰”：与舰艇战舰使用的炮舰大致相同，但装甲更薄；战列巡洋舰往往与战列舰非常相似，经常执行相同的任务。发动机技术的进步和船舶吨位的逐渐增加使得受保护的巡洋舰除了甲板外还可以携带更坚固的装甲带，并保护更多的船只；受保护的巡洋舰演变成后来称为“重型”和“轻型”的巡洋舰。〔2〕巡洋舰的典型速度约为30节（约55公里/小时）；用于巡洋舰的主要武器是重型海军炮兵，其口径约为15英寸（约38厘米），而更普通的巡洋舰则限制为更多的6“8”（15-20厘米）炮。虽然战列巡洋舰经常被卷入战列舰之间的激烈战斗中，尽管它们较薄的装甲保护使它们很容易受到敌人重型火炮的攻击，正如不幸命名的“无敌”号所示，第二次世界大战后，这艘巡洋舰像所有战舰一样在设计上看到了重大的变化，因为空军和导弹技术的进步使得重型海军炮兵过时了。</Chinese>

This button is only available for civs that use the Forced Labor civic in cities that are situated in Sub-Saharan Africa and have a population of at least six. Like the draft action, enslaving costs one unit of population and three unhappiness, and creates a slave unit in this city.
Slaves can also be acquired by defeating Impis and Pombos. If the battle took place on your territory and you are using Forced Labor, there is a chance that you will get a slave unit afterwards.
Another alternative is purchasing slaves by trade from other civilizations, using the slave trade option of the diplomacy screen, which is explained below.[NEWLINE]
[BOLD]奴隶贸易单位[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]It is possible to acquire slaves by trade, which allows civilizations that don't have access to cities in Africa to use slaves. Trade can be conducted through the usual diplomacy interface; if the civilization you are talking to has available slave units, they appear on their side of the negotiation table and can be bought just like any other item. The same is true for the units you own. The slave trade requires that you use at least one of the civics Forced Labor, Agrarianism or Mercantilism. Some civilizations, especially those that like to colonize the New World, place a higher value on slaves; on the other hand, native African civilizations don't value slaves since they are always able to create their own.[NEWLINE]
[BOLD]使用奴隶单位[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]Native African civilizations cannot use slave units. For these civilizations, slaves can only be created for the purpose of selling them to other civilizations. These can use them in two ways:

[BOLD]释放奴隶[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]Both uses of the slave unit (plantations and specialists) can only continue as long as you are running at least one of the civics Forced Labor, Agrarianism or Mercantilism. Should you change your civics so that you are running neither of these, all slave plantations on your territory will revert to normal plantations, and all slave specialists in your cities will be lost permanently. Similarly, if you conquer a city or territory with these features without running the appropriate civics, they will also be lost. If civilizations that are capable of using slave specialists conquer a city that contains them, they are still removed, but the conqueror receives an equal amount of slave units, so that they can either resettle them or move them to a different city.[NEWLINE]
[BOLD]阿兹特克文明[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:2]The Aztec unique power enables them to acquire slave units by winning battles; regardless of the losing unit there is a chance of acquiring a slave unit.

		<English>[TAB]The period following the catastrophic collapse of the Mycenaean civilization in Greece (about 1200 BC) was marked by a series of migrations by barbarian peoples from the north, leading to the formation of a number of city-states - prominent among these, Sparta and Athens - and a phase of Greek colonization along the shores of the Mediterranean. For several centuries, Greek history was a provincial tale of neighbors squabbling over scarce resources. But it was also the dawn of philosophy and science, the era when the bard Homer composed his great epic poems the Iliad and the Odyssey. There seems to be no good reason why the Hellenes, clustered in isolated city-states in a relatively poor and backward land, should have struck out into intellectual regions that were only dimly perceived, if at all, by the splendid civilizations of the Yangtze, the Tigris and Euphrates, and the Nile valleys - but they did.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Persian Wars (492-449 BC) were sparked by a revolt of Greek colonies in Asia Minor and brought the Greeks onto the stage of world history. Athens and Eretria sent a small fleet in support of the revolt, which the Persian emperors took as a pretext for launching two invasions of the Greek mainland. In 490 BC a Persian army under Darius I (522-486 BC) landed unopposed on the plain of Marathon; following an appeal to the Spartans, the Athenian-led Greeks won a decisive victory. A larger second invasion ten years later, blunted by the valiant stand by the Spartans and Thespians at Thermopylae (481 BC), ended with the crushing defeat of the Persian fleet at Salamis. Sporadic fighting between Greek alliances and Persia continued for another 30 years, before the Peace of Callas (449 BC) finally ended the hostilities. The surprising Greek triumph ensured the survival of Greek culture and political structures.[PARAGRAPH:2]Growing tensions among the victors led to the Peloponnesian Wars (431-404 BC), fought between Athens and Sparta. The Athenian League was, in fact, an empire that included most of the island and coastal states around the shores of the Aegean Sea, while Sparta was leader of an alliance of independent cities that included most of the major land powers of the peninsula. The end finally came in 404 BC when, starved by an impenetrable blockade, Athens capitulated. Athens' devastation and decline was perhaps the worst casualty in a war that crippled Greek unity.[PARAGRAPH:2]By this time, a new power was growing in the north of Greece. In 353 BC, Philip I was in undisputed control of a much-enlarged Macedonia. Phalanx tactics were known from ancient Sumer and Egypt, but Philip perfected the tactical use of these spear-wielding forces in dense, massive blocks of eight or even sixteen ranks, sacrificing flexibility and mobility in order to achieve maximum protection and power. Unless Alexander (336-323 BC) was himself responsible for his father's assassination in 336 BC, he could not have foreseen the moment of his succession - but he was certainly well prepared. Educated by Aristotle and left in charge of Macedonia during Philip's attack on Byzantium, Alexander had defeated the barbarians people called the Maedi in 340 BC; two years later he had commanded the left wing at the battle of Chaeronea, in which Philip defeated the allied Greek states and became master of all Greece. Using his father's soliders to good effect, Alexander invaded the Persian Empire and began one of the greatest campaigns in history. Ten years and thousands of miles later, Alexander had destroyed the Persian Empire and carved out a kingdom stretching from Macedonia to the borders of India. By the time of his death at the age of 33, Alexander had initiated a new age by spreading Hellenism in a vast colonizing wave throughout the Middle East and created, at least economically and culturally (if not politically), a single civilization stretching from Gibraltar to the Punjab, open to trade and intellectual intercourse.[PARAGRAPH:2]However, the Greek empire could hardly survive Alexander's death. During a 40-year (323-280 BC) interregnum, the provinces became independent kingdoms, with various of Alexander's generals rising to rule through bloodshed and assassination, yet they were unable to ally against the coming of a new military power. By 350 BC, Rome was encroaching on the westernmost Greek settlements, beginning a 200-year conquest of the Hellenic world that Alexander had created. With the defeat of Cleopatra and Marc Anthony, Octavian's forces occupied Egypt and the last kingdom of Alexander's successors fell to Rome. For two millennia, Greece was part of the Roman, then Byzantine, and finally the Ottoman empires. Following an uprising supported by Britain, Russia, and France, Greece's existence as an independent nation gained formal recognition in 1832. Greece fought on the Allied side in both world wars, and was occupied by the Germans during World War II. A civil war followed the conflict, in which pro-Western forces defeated their pro-communist opponents. Greece today is a modern democracy and part of the European Union, and tens of thousands of tourists visit the country every year to see its rugged beauty and great monuments from the past.</English>

		<Chinese>在希腊的迈锡尼文明毁灭性的大崩解后的一段时期中（约公元前1200年），北方的蛮族不断向南迁移并定居下来，他们建立了一系列的城邦——其中最大的两个城邦是斯巴达和雅典——这也是希腊人向地中海沿海地区殖民的时期。此后两个世纪的希腊历史充斥着各城邦之间为占有稀缺资源而不断进行的争斗。但其间也缓慢孕育着哲学和科学的萌芽。似乎没什么令人信服的理由可以使人相信，居住在这样一块相对贫瘠而且不断退化土地上，被分裂成一系列城邦的希腊人也能创造出可以与长江流域，底格里斯河-幼发拉底河流域和尼罗河流域的伟大文明相比的灿烂文明，但是，他们做到了。[PARAGRAPH:2]希波战争（前492-前449）是因为小亚细亚的希腊殖民地暴动而引发的，这个事件使得希腊人登上了世界历史的舞台。雅典与埃瑞特里亚派遣了一小支舰队支持叛军，波斯的皇帝就以此为借口对希腊本土发动了两次的侵略战争。前490年，大流士一世（前522-前486在位）麾下的一支波斯军队在没有受到任何抵抗的情况下登上了马拉松平原，雅典人赶紧向斯巴达求援，最后以雅典为首的军队赢得了决定性的胜利。十年之后第二次战争爆发，勇猛的斯巴达人和塞斯皮亚人在温泉关奋力抵抗（前481年），最终以波斯舰队在萨拉米斯湾大败而告终。希腊联邦与波斯的小规模战争又断断续续地持续了30年之久，直到卡拉斯和约（前449年）签订后才结束了这场冲突。希腊人奇迹般的胜利确保了希腊文化和政治体制的延续。[PARAGRAPH:2]此后胜利者内部的紧张关系又导致了伯罗奔尼撒战争的爆发（前431-前404），敌对双方分别是雅典和斯巴达。以雅典为首的联盟囊括了爱琴海中大部分的岛屿和沿岸城邦，而斯巴达则是半岛上大部分陆地城邦联盟的领袖。战争最后于前404年结束，雅典在无法打破的封锁之下因粮草难继而被迫投降。雅典的战败和没落也许是这场战争对希腊社会的最严重打击。[PARAGRAPH:2]就在此时，希腊北部有一新兴势力崛起。前353年，腓力二世牢固地统治了疆域大大扩展的马其顿。腓力用密集的装备着长矛的重装步兵完善了早在古苏美尔和埃及人时代就已有之的方阵战术。希腊方阵是以八人甚至是十六人密集排成纵列，虽然牺牲了作战灵活性和机动性，但是却拥有最大的防护和攻击力。不论亚历山大（前336-前323在位）本人是否牵涉其中，前336年他父亲腓力二世的遇刺促使他提前继承了这个王国。不过他当然已经准备好了，他自小受亚里士多德的教育，并在父亲出征拜占庭时掌管马其顿政局，并成功平定了麦狄人的叛乱。两年之后，他在凯罗尼亚战役中负责率领左翼部队，在此战中腓力二世击败了希腊城邦的联军，成为全希腊的统治者。继承其父军事遗产的亚历山大发动了对波斯的进攻，获得历史上空前绝后的辉煌胜利。经过历时十年的千里远征，亚历山大最终灭亡波斯帝国，将马其顿的边境一直推进到印度，当他于33岁英年早逝时，亚历山大已经开启了一个新的时代，希腊文化传遍了中东各地。西起直布罗陀，东到印度旁遮普的广阔范围都在经济和文化上同属一个文明（虽然并不存在一个同样庞大的政治实体），东西方贸易和科技的交流畅通无阻。[PARAGRAPH:2]不过这个希腊帝国在亚历山大死后就逐渐土崩瓦解了，在40年的空位期（前323-前280）中，各个行省纷纷独立成王国，亚历山大麾下的一些将领在流血冲突与暗杀事件中纷纷自立，无法团结起来面对新的军事威胁。前350年左右，罗马开始侵扰希腊西部的一些城邦，此后便开始一场历时200年的征服，亚历山大所建立的希腊化世界被逐渐并吞。在克利奥巴特拉与马可·安东尼被击败后，屋大维的军队占领了埃及，亚历山大的继承者的最后一个王国终于也落到罗马人手中。在随后的两千年中，希腊先后被罗马，拜占庭以及奥斯曼帝国所统治。后来在英国，俄国和法国协助下，希腊人发动起义宣布独立，并于1832年获得正式承认。在两次世界大战中，希腊都加入同盟国一方作战，并在第二次世界大战中被德国占领。战后希腊爆发内战，最终亲西方的力量击败了共产党的力量。今天的希腊实行民主政体，并且是欧盟的成员国，每年都有成千上万的国外旅游者访问这个国家，感受她永恒的魅力和昔日的辉煌。</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]Meritocracy is a political philosophy holding that power should be vested in individuals almost exclusively based on ability and talent. Advancement in such a system is based on performance measured through examination and/or demonstrated achievement in the field where it is implemented. According to scholarly consensus, the earliest example of an administrative meritocracy, based on civil service examinations, dates back to Ancient China.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]The concept originates, at least by the sixth century BC, when it was advocated by the Chinese philosopher Confucius, who "invented the notion that those who govern should do so because of merit, not of inherited status. This sets in motion the creation of the imperial examinations and bureaucracies open only to those who passed tests."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]As the Qin and Han dynasties developed a meritocratic system in order to maintain power over a large, sprawling empire, it became necessary for the government to maintain a complex network of officials. Prospective officials could come from a rural background and government positions were not restricted to the nobility. Rank was determined by merit, through the civil service examinations, and education became the key for social mobility. After the fall of the Han Dynasty, the nine-rank system was established during the Three Kingdoms period.</English>

Other texts observe that the Great Fires were also vehicles of propaganda and symbols of imperial sovereignty.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Farnbag fire (translated as 'the fire Glory-Given' by Darmesteter) was considered the most venerated of the three because it was seen as the earthly representative of the Atar Spenishta, 'Holiest Fire' of Yasna 17.11 and described in a Zend commentary on that verse as the "the one burning in Paradise in the presence of Ohrmazd."</English>

It is a global navigation satellite system that provides geolocation and time information to a GPS receiver anywhere on or near the Earth where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites. Obstacles such as mountains and buildings block the relatively weak GPS signals.[PARAGRAPH:2]The GPS does not require the user to transmit any data, and it operates independently of any telephonic or internet reception, though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the GPS positioning information. The GPS provides critical positioning capabilities to military, civil, and commercial users around the world.

It was allowed for civilian use in the 1980s. Advances in technology and new demands on the existing system have now led to efforts to modernize the GPS and implement the next generation of GPS Block IIIA satellites and Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX). Announcements from Vice President Al Gore and the White House in 1998 initiated these changes. In 2000, the U.S. Congress authorized the modernization effort, GPS III.

He energetically promoted trade and shipping, left a national heritage of fine buildings, and won repute as a plucky, hard-drinking man of grim wit and great resource.[PARAGRAPH:2]Christian, the son of Frederick II of Denmark and Sophia of Mecklenburg, succeeded to the throne on the death of his father in 1588, but until his coronation in 1596 his country was governed by a regency of four members of the Rigsrad, the privy council, who also supervised his education. He was brought up as a Lutheran and studied Latin, French, Italian, and German as well as mathematics, navigation, drawing, military command, fencing, and dancing.[PARAGRAPH:2]After his coronation Christian succeeded in limiting the powers of the Rigsrad. He kept the most important offices vacant and surrounded himself with an entourage of aristocratic young officers and German officials drawn mainly from his dukedom of Holstein. The Rigsrad was opposed to a war against Sweden, but Christian threatened to declare war in his capacity as duke of Schleswig-Holstein, thus forcing the Rigsrad to sanction plans for a war (1611-13), with the aim of once more uniting Sweden with Denmark. Although Christian won the war, his victory remained essentially inconclusive.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the war Christian centred his efforts on the economic development of his kingdom; he founded new towns, particularly ports to strengthen defenses, enlarged the royal shipyards, and built beautiful buildings and castles in and around Copenhagen. When the Protestant cause in northern Germany was endangered, in 1624, Christian entered the Thirty Years' War, again in opposition to his councillors. His aims were to protect Danish interests in northern Germany, to stop the Swedish king from playing a role in European politics, and to take up the legacy of his father and grandfather as the leading member of the Lutheran Church and its defender against expanding Catholicism. In 1625 he began operations against the Catholic League in Germany led by Tilly, the Bavarian commander in chief, who defeated him at Lutter am Barenberge on Aug. 17, 1626. Tilly's and Wallenstein's troops next invaded and plundered Jutland, thus forcing Christian to form an alliance with the Swedish king Gustavus II Adolphus against the Catholics. After the Swedish-Danish army and fleet had forced Wallenstein to raise the siege of Stralsund, however, Christian severed the alliance and concluded a separate peace with the Holy Roman emperor at L黚eck in May 1629. Though Christian's prestige and even his faith in himself as a great captain were diminished, he had not lost any lands. After the war he continued to try to impede Swedish progress in northern Germany and to maintain his rights in the Baltic and the North Sea. He repeatedly raised the shipping tolls through The Sound into the Baltic in order to augment his income independently of the Rigsrad, but he thus alienated his old allies, the sea powers of England and the Netherlands. With the help of the Netherlands, Sweden attacked Denmark in December 1643; and, by the end of January 1644, Jutland was in their possession. Christian led the defense personally, blockading the Swedish ships for a time, and lost an eye in the naval battle of Kolberger Heide. Although this battle was inconclusive, the Danish fleet was later annihilated by the combined navies of Sweden and Holland, and Christian was compelled to conclude a humiliating peace in August 1645 that cost him possessions in the Baltic, Norway, and Scania. Throughout his reign the Rigsrad and the nobility had opposed his warlike policies and the ensuing strain on finances, and after this defeat even Christian's sons-in-law turned against him, forcing him to accept the increased power of the nobility. Though he died a bitter and broken man, Christian IV had ruled his kingdom for more than 50 years and is remembered as one of the most popular of Danish kings.[PARAGRAPH:2]Christian IV was inclined to occupy himself with every minor detail of his administration while losing sight of the larger problems. Not only did he personally lay down the lines of Denmark's mercantilistic policy, he even established the import duties; he started state-subsidized and privileged trading companies and manufacturies-all of them with no marked success-and insisted on auditing their accounts personally. He founded a new academy for young noblemen, provided funds for the students at the university and built them a new college, personally examined the knowledge of Latin and the religious orthodoxy of the clergymen due for promotion, made designs for new types of guns and tested them himself, inspected the contents of the new arsenals, acted as a judge even in minor cases, and tried out the new ships of his navy. Christian was a great builder and founder of cities. He founded the towns of Kristiania (now Oslo) and Kristiansand in Norway; Kristianstad and Kristianopel in what is now Sweden; Christianshavn in Denmark; and Gl點kstadt (which was to compete with Hamburg) in Holstein. Evidence of his unremitting industry are his more than 3,000 handwritten letters still preserved, written in an imaginative and vivid Danish prose and teeming with orders and questions on all subjects from the eternal laws of God to the brewing of stronger beer.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_CIV_MONGOL_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]The Mongol tribes entered into history with the birth of Temujin, born in c.1167 AD in the wild steppe-land of Mongolia, which is bordered by modern China and Russia.  When Temujin was nine years old, tribal rivals poisoned and murdered his father Yesugei, creating a power vacuum in the tribe that resulted in the exile of young Temujin and his family as fugitives. In time Temujin would return to claim his inheritance, forge political alliances, and vanquish old rivals. In 1204 AD he summoned a kuriltai war council and proceeded to unite all local nomad tribes by force, becoming the first man ever to unite the Mongols. It was at this time he received the title 'Genghis Khan', meaning 'Great Ruler'.[PARAGRAPH:2]China, at the time, was divided into three parts: the Ch'in, who were the most powerful, reigned in the north at Beijing; the Sung occupied the South; and the Hsi-Hsia, the weakest of the 3, inhabited the western flank of the Great Wall.  The Mongol conquest against China began in 1211 when the consolidated tribes of the Great Khan struck at the Hsi-Hsia, with tremendous success.  Not impressed with the defeat of his weaker neighbor, the new Emperor of Ch'in insisted on a public display of servitude from Temujin. Temujin reacted by ordering a general advance against the Ch'in Empire.  The resulting war lasted for approximately 23 years, and ended in the complete destruction of the Ch'in. Although the Mongols began the war as nomadic horsemen, by the time they defeated the Ch'in they had learned how to use advanced siege weaponry to capture cities. During this campaign Temujin ensured that the epic war upon the Ch'in did not occupy all of his resources and time; there were older enemies to address.[PARAGRAPH:2]Amid the war against the Ch'in the Mongols also rallied against the Kara-Khitay, one of the original Kuchlug tribes that had fled from defeat during Temujin's war of unification.  Victory over the Kara-Khitay provided the Mongols a common frontier with the Shah of Khwarizm, who ruled a large Muslim state that stretched from modern day Iran to southern Russia as far as the Caspian and Aral Seas.  Temujin initially attempted to establish friendly relations with the Shah Ala-al-Din, but he was contemptuously rebuffed, and the Mongol emissary killed. That was a mistake. In 1219 a Mongol horde estimated at 100,000 horsemen invaded Khwarizm and the other cities that lay along the rich Silk Way. Due to their stubborn resistance, the cities of Khwarizm were destroyed, their populations slaughtered or enslaved, and the area almost completely depopulated. Ala-al-Din fled in exile and died shortly thereafter. In many respects, this area today still has not recovered from the Mongol invasion.[PARAGRAPH:2]After destroying Khwarizm, the Mongols had access to Russia.  Not content with remaining a peaceful neighbor, Temujin's successor Ogodai permitted his generals to lead an extraordinary campaign into southern Russia, which would be staged largely in the winter months. In a series of campaigns between 1237-40, the Mongols completely subjected the various principalities of Russia, destroying anyone who opposed them. From Russia, the Mongols continued their western advance by invading Poland, Silesia, and Hungary. They easily defeated the armies of Poland, Germany, and Hungary, and appeared poised to erupt into Western Europe. But the death of Ogodai, the great khan, caused the armies to retreat in order to seek new orders, thus sparing most of Europe from destruction. Less fortunate was the Muslim world, as Baghdad was sacked in 1258 by yet another Mongol army and the Caliph executed by being trampeled to death beneath Mongol horses. The destruction of Baghdad and slaughtering of its population was a blow that the Arab Empire of the Caliphs never fully recovered from. The Mongols were finally turned back for the first time by the Mameluks of Egypt in 1260.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mongol children were taught to ride on horseback from the age of three, and were given bow and arrows to use for hunting at the age of five. Horseback riding became a natural way for the Mongols to conduct war.  When speed was essential, a Mongol rider could even sleep while in the saddle; and by using a system that consisted of approximately four remounts, Temujin's army was capable of traversing 130 miles in two days, with no breaks for food. Another defining characteristic of a Mongolian army was the speed and voracity with which it was able to accept and prepare for battle.  The Mongols' harsh, nomadic lifestyle had prepared them well for the rigors of war; and they often thrived in conditions that would be considered intolerable by any other military of its time.  When the need arose they could last up to ten days at a time without cooking food, during which they would sustain themselves by drinking the blood of their horses. Their primary weapon consisted of horse archers called Keshiks, who could fire with great speed and incredible accuracy from the back of a saddle. The mobility of the Mongol forces gave them a great tactical advantage within battles that Mongol generals would exploit over and over again.[PARAGRAPH:2]Every victory wrought by the Mongols was followed by slaughters of incredible scale.  No citizens, with the exception of those who were useful to the Mongol war effort, were spared in these attacks.  In 1221, the Islamic city of Merv was captured; 700,000 were murdered (this number is almost certainly exaggerated but still amazing), and a rearguard was assembled to dispatch any citizens who were fortunate enough to have escaped the original slaughter - this was routine work for the Mongol army. It is said that Temujin planned to depopulate northern China for use as a pasture for his livestock, until being told that subjects would pay more in taxes than cattle.[PARAGRAPH:2]By the end of the 13th century Mongol armies had been involved in action in countries including: Poland, Japan, Korea, Hungary, Russia, Palestine, Egypt, Persia, India, China, Cambodia, Burma, Vietnam, and Indonesia.  After Temujin's death in 1227 five more Khans would follow, including Kublai Khan, whose triumph was the union of all of China under his rule.  However, the death of Kublai Khan in 1294 AD marked the end of an era for Mongol conquests, and the march of Mongol armies began to decline. While many of the khanates founded by the Mongols lasted for several more centuries, the age of the great nomadic forces was over. Although their era was brief in duration, the Mongols conquered the largest empire the world has ever seen and terrorized virtually the entire Eurasian continent.</English>

		<Chinese>随着铁木真1167年诞生于被现今中俄边界所围绕着的蒙古大草原，蒙古民族的历史才真正开始。在铁木真八岁时，他的父亲也速该被敌人毒死，造成部族的权力真空和内部争斗，年幼的铁木真及其家人被迫过着悲惨的流亡生活。但最终铁木真卷土重来夺回继承权，联合盟友消灭仇敌，至1204年统一了蒙古高原。1206年他召集蒙古各部在斡难河源召开忽里台大会，并被推举为“成吉思汗”，即“伟大的统治者”。[PARAGRAPH:2]而当时的中国本部正处于三个政权分立的局面：统治北方，力量最强的金朝；偏安江南，经济繁荣的宋朝；以及占据长城西翼，力量最弱的西夏。成吉思汗在1209年迫使西夏归附之后，又于1211年率军南下，意欲逐鹿中原。新继位的金朝皇帝对弱小邻国的战败并不以为然，仍坚持要求铁木真向他称臣。铁木真乃下令对金帝国发动全面进攻。这场战争持续了23年，最后以金朝的灭亡而告终。起初的蒙古军队只是精于骑射，但到他们战胜金朝之时，已经掌握了重型武器的使用和攻打城池的技术。而除了金朝进行的漫长战争，铁木真还要同时面对更多的对手。[PARAGRAPH:2]在攻打金朝的同时，蒙古人还与西辽（哈剌契丹）作战，因为在蒙古统一战争中失败的乃蛮部王子屈出律逃亡至此并夺取了西辽帝位。灭亡西辽之后的蒙古开始与信奉伊斯兰教的花剌子模接壤，当时的花剌子模国王统治着包括今伊朗及原苏联中亚里海和咸海地区的广阔土地。起初铁木真曾试图与花剌子模国王阿拉-阿尔-丁建立友好关系，但被对方轻蔑地拒绝了，蒙古的使臣也被斩杀。花剌子模国王犯下了一个巨大的错误。1219年，十万蒙古大军发动了对花剌子模及其他丝绸之路沿线城市的入侵。由于在围攻时遇到强烈抵抗，蒙古人完全摧毁了花剌子模城作为报复，所有市民被屠杀或卖为奴隶，原本的繁华城市从此成为一片废墟。阿拉-阿尔-丁本人也在不久之后死于流亡途中。可以说这片地区直到今天都还未能从蒙古人的蹂躏下恢复过来。[PARAGRAPH:2]灭亡花剌子模使蒙古人打开了通向俄罗斯大草原的通道。继铁木真之后成为大汗的窝阔台不希望与任何邻国保持和平，于是派遣部下率军入侵基辅罗斯并大获全胜，而且这场战役还是在严寒的冬季进行的。历经三年征战（1237-1240），蒙古人消灭或臣服了各个罗斯公国，随即又从俄罗斯大草原出发继续向西入侵波兰、西里西亚和匈牙利。蒙古人轻松击败了波兰、日耳曼和匈牙利各国联军，大有横扫整个欧洲之势。但窝阔台却在此时因酗酒而意外暴亡，各路蒙古大军匆忙撤退回国以推举新的大汗，欧洲才得以免遭毁灭的命运。但穆斯林世界就没有这么幸运了，另一支蒙古大军于1258年攻陷巴格达，阿拔斯朝的末代哈里发被塞进布袋，用马蹄践踏而死。强盛一时的阿拉伯帝国从此一蹶不振。此后蒙古人继续向西进攻，但于1260年被埃及马穆鲁克王朝军队击退。[PARAGRAPH:2]蒙古小孩三岁就开始骑马，五岁就要拿起弓箭去狩猎。蒙古人可以说是天生的骑兵。如果时间紧迫，蒙古骑手甚至可以在马鞍上睡觉；每个蒙古骑兵都有至少二匹甚至三四匹马，可以在行进中轮流骑乘以节省马力，这使铁木真的军队可以几乎不停顿地在两天内行进130英里。蒙古军队最大的特点就是高速机动与疯狂掠夺，对战斗充满渴求。蒙古人习惯于艰苦的游牧生活，非常适应严酷的战争环境，他们往往能够在同时期的其他军队感到无法忍受的条件下保持高昂的斗志。必要时他们可以连续十天不生火做饭，而只靠饮用马血维生。蒙古骑射手是这支大军的主力，他们能在马背上连续而精准地射击。蒙古骑射手的高度的灵活性和机动性使他们在任何情况下都能够占据主动赢得优势。[PARAGRAPH:2]蒙古人获得的每一场胜利都伴随着规模惊人的屠杀。蒙古人所俘获的人口，只有能为军队出力者才能够幸免于难。公元1221年穆斯林城市马鲁被攻陷后，70万居民全部被屠杀（虽然这个数字应该有所夸大），蒙古人专门安排了预备队。以追捕有幸在最初的杀戳中逃脱的人——这对蒙古军队来说就像例行公事。传说铁木真曾经计划屠尽中国北部的居民，并将所有农田改为牧场，直到下属告诉他征收赋税比放牧牛羊更为合算时才作罢。[PARAGRAPH:2]到13世纪末期曾经遭受过蒙古大军入侵的国家和地区包括：波兰、日本、朝鲜、匈牙利、俄罗斯、巴勒斯坦、埃及、波斯、印度、中国、柬埔寨、缅甸、越南和爪哇等。1227年铁木真去世，其后的五位大汗继续他的扩张政策，他的孙子忽必烈汗取得了征服整个中国的业绩。但1294年忽必列汗的去世标志着蒙古大征服时代的结束，蒙古大军的征战从此停止，虽然蒙古人所建立的各大汗国继续存在了几个世纪的时间，但游牧民族强盛的时代已逐渐成为历史。虽然持续的时间很短暂，但蒙古人所建大帝国的疆域之广阔是人类历史上空前绝后的，几乎囊括了整个亚欧大陆。</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]In 1598, when Shah Abbas decided to move the capital of his empire from the north-western city of Qazvin to the central city of Isfahan, he initiated what would become one of the greatest programmes in Persian history; the complete remaking of the city. By choosing the central city of Isfahan, fertilized by the Z&#257;yande roud ("The life-giving river"), lying as an oasis of intense cultivation in the midst of a vast area of arid landscape, he distanced his capital from any future assaults by the Ottomans, the arch rival of the Safavids, and the Uzbeks, and at the same time gained more control over the Persian Gulf, which had recently become an important trading route for the Dutch and British East India Companies.[PARAGRAPH:2]The chief architect of this colossal task of urban planning was Shaykh Bahai (Baha' ad-Din al-`Amili), who focused the programme on two key features of Shah Abbas's master plan: the Chahar Bagh avenue, flanked at either side by all the prominent institutions of the city, such as the residences of all foreign dignitaries, and the Naqsh-e Jahan Square ("Exemplar of the World"). Prior to the Shah's ascent to power, Persia had a decentralized power-structure, in which different institutions battled for power, including both the military (the Qizilbash) and governors of the different provinces making up the empire. Shah Abbas wanted to undermine this political structure, and the recreation of Isfahan, as a Grand capital of Persia, was an important step in centralizing the power. The ingenuity of the square, or Maid&#257;n, was that, by building it, Shah Abbas would gather the three main components of power in Persia in his own backyard; the power of the clergy, represented by the Masjed-e Shah, the power of the merchants, represented by the Imperial Bazaar, and of course, the power of the Shah himself, residing in the Ali Qapu Palace.</English>

		<English>[H1]Stability[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]The stability system from Rhye's and Fall has been replaced in Dawn of Civilization, which features a completely redesigned stability mechanic. The main principle of the new system are that there is no permanent stability score. Instead, every civilization has a stability level: Collapsing, Unstable, Shaky, Stable, or Solid. [PARAGRAPH:2]During the game, a number of events (see below) can trigger a stability check. During the check, a score is calculated that reflects the current stability of your empire on a variety of factors in the areas of expansion, economic, domestic, foreign and military. If the score is consistent with your stability level, it remains unchanged. But with exceedingly high or low scores, the stability can either drop or increase a level. However, stability only becomes threatening once it has been reduced all the way to Collapsing, and stability can only decrease or increase by one level by check. This means that higher stability levels provide a buffer against collapse. But even after falling all the way down to Collapsing, your civilisation is not doomed yet. If the next stability check results in the same or a higher stability score, even if it does not improve your stability level to Unstable, your civilisation will remain intact. Otherwise however, it will descend into total collapse and you lose the game.
[H2]Stability Levels[\H2]Stability levels represent the overall stability of your empire. Stability levels are persistent and should not be confused with the stability score which is calculated on stability checks according to the rules described below, and then discarded. There are five stability levels from best to worst:
[ICON_BULLET]Solid
[ICON_BULLET]Stable
[ICON_BULLET]Shaky
[ICON_BULLET]Unstable
[ICON_BULLET]Collapsing
Your stability level can change during a stability check. As long it is higher than Collapsing, your empire is safe. High stability levels provide more protection from collapse, since every check can reduce your stability by at most one level.
[H2]Stability Checks[\H2]A stability check is when the game determines the current stability score of your civilisation. The following events can trigger a stability check:
[ICON_BULLET]losing a city
[ICON_BULLET]razing a city (human only)
[ICON_BULLET]discovering a technology
[ICON_BULLET]becoming a vassal
[ICON_BULLET]acquiring a vassal (+)
[ICON_BULLET]starting a war
[ICON_BULLET]making peace (+)
[ICON_BULLET]changing civics or state religion
[ICON_BULLET]moving your capital
[ICON_BULLET]building a wonder (+)
[ICON_BULLET]starting a golden age (+)
[ICON_BULLET]receiving a great person (+)
[NEWLINE]Events marked with a (+) are positive stability checks. These checks can never reduce your stability level, no matter how bad your stability score is.
[NEWLINE]During a check, your stability score is calculated according to the rules described under Stability Influence Factors. This score is compared to the stability threshold. Based on this comparison, the stability check can have three possible outcomes:
[NEWLINE][BOLD]Positive:[\BOLD] The stability score exceeds the threshold by more than 10 points
[BOLD]Neutral:[\BOLD] The stability score is equal to or greater than the threshold (but by not more than 10 points)
[BOLD]Negative:[\BOLD] The stability score is less than the threshold
[NEWLINE]The threshold itself depends on your situation. In particular, it depends on the current stability level:
[ICON_BULLET]on solid: +20
[ICON_BULLET]on unstable: +10
[ICON_BULLET]on shaky: 0
[ICON_BULLET]on unstable: -10
[ICON_BULLET]on collapsing: -20
[NEWLINE]Due to the different thresholds, it becomes progressively harder to drop to a lower level, and easier to increase your level again. This means that unless something about your civilisation changes to affect your stability score, your stability level will ultimately settle on the level that reflects it.
[NEWLINE]The threshold is lower during a Golden Age. This means that Golden Ages can save you from situations that would otherwise lead to collapse, and are the perfect time to increase stability levels again.
[NEWLINE]The consequences of the outcome of a stability check are as follows:
[BOLD]Positive:[\BOLD] The stability level increases by one.
[BOLD]Neutral:[\BOLD] The stability level remains unchanged.
[BOLD]Negative:[\BOLD] The stability level decreases by one. If the stability level already was on Collapsing, and the stability score is lower than at the last check, a complete collapse occurs.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Kingdom of Mapungubwe was a pre-colonial Southern African state located at the confluence of the Shashe and Limpopo rivers. It marked the centre of a pre-Shona kingdom, which covered parts of modern-day Botswana and Zimbabwe. The Kingdom was the first stage in a development that would culminate in the creation of the Kingdom of Great Zimbabwe. The history of Zimbabwe is vague; during the colonial-era Europeans went out of their way to warp the Kingdoms history for many reasons, such as the Great Zimbabwe ruins, which they intended to claim as their own. [PARAGRAPH:1]The date to which the Kingdom was found is unclear, with foundation placed anywhere from the fourth-century to the tenth. Though it is possible that it started wen earlier. Bantu migrants would settle in the area during the Great Bantu Expansion, there they merged with the other African societies already thriving there. The Bantu, together with the other African peoples, would develop the most complex civilisation in southern Africa, they would develop culture and kingship and the Kingdom of Mapungubwe would be born. The kingdom would thrive for centuries, constructing marvellous stone buildings and conducting trade with other kingdoms as far as Persia, Egypt, India and even China., It's lands full of rich resources, especially ivory and gold. Evidence of such trade with far away nations indicated that Mapungubwe had developed a complex financial system rather early, for Chinese artefacts dating back centuries were discovered in the ruins of Great Zimbabawe.[PARAGRAPH:1]Over  time the traditional, family oriented Kingdom would expand northwards and grow into the medieval Kingdom of Great Zimbabwe, famous for it's majestic capital, Great Zimbabwe (of which the Kingdom takes it's name) the largest stone structure in African until recent times. But the Kingdom would also be known for it's vast riches in gold which it had in abundance and which would eventually bring it's downfall by the hands of greedy Imperialists. [PARAGRAPH:1] During the reign of the Kingdom of ZImbabwe, stone buildings and walls reached their apex, being grand architecture in the area, the kingdom would also expand it's rule to reach far and wide over the vast area of which they lay claim. The Kingdom of Zimbabwe controlled the ivory and gold trade from the interior to the southeastern coast of Africa. Asian and Arabic goods could be found in abundance in the Kingdom. Though, because the Kingdom was so inland and rather Isolationistic, it grew completely independent of any outside influence, that even when the coast was being infested by foreigners whom brought their own culture of destruction, the Kingdom of Zimbabwe would not even notice and thus grew to greatness with the foreign corruption by Arabs or Europeans. [PARAGRAPH:1]The Kingdom would continue to evolve, expanding north where they would become known as the Mutapa Kingdom of which quickly established rule of a vast area of Southern Africa, that by the time the first European Imperialists made contact, Mutapa would rule most of Southern Africa as the premier state in the whole region. Over time though, the Imperialistic Portuguese would come to dominate much of southeast Africa's coastline, laying waste to the peaceful Swahili city states of Sofala and Kilwa by the sixteenth century. Their main goal was to dominate the trade with India; however, they unwittingly became mere carriers for luxury goods between the Great Mutapa and the Orient. Mutapa proved invulnerable to attack and even economic manipulation due to the mwenemutapa's strong control over gold production. What posed the greatest threat to the Empire was infighting among different factions which led to opposing sides calling on the Portuguese for military aid. In 1629 the mwenemutapa attempted to throw out the Portuguese blight, but he failed and was overthrown, leading to the Portuguese installation of Mavura Mhande Felipe on the Throne. Under this Portuguese puppet, Mutapa signed treaties making it a Portuguese vassal and ceding gold mines to the Imperialists, however none of these concessions were ever put into effect and Mutapa managed to maintain nominal independence. All the while, Portugal increased control over much of southeast Africa with the beginnings of a wicked colonial system and the fall of Mutapa, of Zimbabwe, was under way. [PARAGRAPH:1]However the collapse of Mutapa to a Protuguese vassal would not go smoothly. Although rough progression afterwards, the legacy of Great Zimbabwe would live on free for years to come. The Rozwi not long after the initial fall of Mutapa, would move in and beat back the Portuguese, driving them far back only to retain a nominal presence at one of the fairs in the eastern highlands. The Rozwi would reestablish Zimbabwean rule of the area, over the years the Rozwi Empire would engage in battles with the Portugueses many times to fight for freedom, peace and liberty in Africa and the region would continue independence from the European Scourge that would bring about hell to the peoples of Africa. The Rozwi chiefs would carry on the traditions of the Great Zimbabweans, building in stone and constructing impressive cities throughout the southwest. The economic power of the Rozwi Empire was based on cattle wealth and farming while significant gold mining continued with less dominance on the Rozwi Economy. The Trade was established with Arab traders, metals such as gold and copper and ivory were exchanged for luxury goods. Records form the Portuguese account have shown that the Rozwi were expert military strategists and that they had used the cow-horn formation years before the Great Zulu leader Shaka had. Without the use of guns and cannons, but spears and bows and arrows, the belligerent Rozwi took over the plateau from the Imperialist European. However, despite complex political systems and bast wealth and culture, the Kingdom of Rozwi would eventually fall the imperialist they fought so hard to fend their people from. Over time, more Europeans would join forces with the Portuguese against the Rozwi and use trickery and deceit to turn brother against brother, and despite the Rozwi's mighty martial prowess, bows and arrows simple could not best guns and cannons and the determination of imperialistic ambition all the time. And thus, in the nineteenth century, the Great Zimbabwe legacy would come to an end.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Clergy refers to a hierarchical and institutional structure within a religion. In particular, the clergy itself is the religious leadership present in various organised religions. The names of members of the clergy vary from religion to religion, but their duties are often similar: interpreting existing religious texts and traditions, resolving open religious questions, and administering the religious organisation itself. Since religion is often an important aspect in the legitimisation of secular power, clergy can often be involved in worldly government or even hold such power itself. The various Christian denominations are the most prominent examples here. The leader of Catholic Christianity, the Pope, once exercised control over much of Italy, and bishops and monastic orders used to rule regions of Europe without any dependence on a higher monarch.</English>

In 279 BC, he led an army of Celtic warriors on an invasion of Macedonia and northern Greece. They turned the Greek defense at the pass of Thermopylae and sacked the famous Oracle at Delphi - Brennus was wounded in the fighting. From there, the Celts penetrated into Epirus (roughly modern Albania) and looted the treasures stored at the temples of Zeus at Dodona and Olympia. After those triumphs the Greek resistance stiffened. Brennus retreated to Macedonia, where he died of his wounds. Without the leadership of their chieftain, the Celtic warriors split up and went in separate directions. Most of them returned to their homes in Gaul along with the treasure they had pillaged, while a few others headed east and settled in Asia Minor. This group came to be called the Galatians, and remained distinct from their surrounding neighbors for at least two centuries.[PARAGRAPH:2]The name "Brennus" is more likely a title than a proper name - in fact the same title was later given to another Celtic chieftain who sacked Rome in 390 BC.

A Javanese ship is made of very thick wood, and as it gets old, the Javanese fix it with new boards. The rope and the sail is made with osier. The Javanese junks were made using jaty/jati wood (teak) at the time of his report (1512), at that time Chinese junks were still using softwood as their main material. The Javanese ship's hull is formed by joining planks to the keel and then to each other by wooden dowels, without using either a frame (except for subsequent reinforcement), nor any iron bolts or nails. The vessel was similarly pointed at both ends, and carried two oar-like rudders and lateen-rigged sails. It differed markedly from the Chinese vessel, which had its hull fastened by strakes and iron nails to a frame and to structurally essential bulkheads which divided the cargo space. The Chinese vessel had a single rudder on a transom stern, and (except in Fujian and Guangdong) they had flat bottoms without keels.[7] Historical engravings also depict usage of bowsprits and bowsprit sails, with deckhouse above the upper deck, and the appearance of stemposts and sternposts.[PARAGRAPH:2]Barbosa also reported various goods carried by these ships, which include rice, meat of cows, sheep, pigs, and deer, dried and salted, many chickens, garlic, and onions. Traded weapons include lances, dagger, and swords, worked in inlaid metal and very good steel. Also brought with them cubebs and yellow die called cazumba (kasumba) and gold which is produced in Java. Barosa mention places and route in which these ships visited, which include Malacca, China, Molucca Islands, Sumatra, Tenasserim, Pegu, Bengal, Palicat, Coromandel, Malabar, Cambay, and Aden. The passenger brought their wives and children, even some of them never leave the ship to go on shore, nor have any other dwelling, for they are born and die in the ship.[PARAGRAPH:2]The size and special requirements of the djong demanded access to expertise and materials not available everywhere. Consequently, the djong was mainly constructed in two major shipbuilding centres around Java: north coastal Java, especially around Rembang-Demak (along the Muria strait) and Cirebon; and the south coast of Borneo (Banjarmasin) and the adjacent islands. A common feature of these places was their accessibility to forests of teak, as this wood was highly valued because of its resistance to shipworm. Southern Borneo's supply of teak would have come from north Java, whereas Borneo itself would supply ironwood. Pegu, which is a large shipbuilding port at the 16th century, also produced jong, built by Javanese who resided there.</English>

		<English>[TAB]An artist is a person engaged in one or more of any of a broad spectrum of activities related to creating art, practicing the arts, and/or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse is a practitioner in the visual arts only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (less often for actors). "Artiste" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is certainly valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Leopard (Panthera pardus) is one of the five "big cats" in the genus Panthera. It is a member of the Felidae family with a wide range in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa, West Asia, the Middle East, South and Southeast Asia to Siberia.[PARAGRAPH:1]Compared to other members of the Felidae, the leopard has relatively short legs and a long body with a large skull. It is similar in appearance to the jaguar, but is smaller and more slightly built. Its fur is marked with rosettes similar to those of the jaguar, but the leopard's rosettes are smaller and more densely packed, and do not usually have central spots as the jaguars do. Both leopards and jaguars that are melanistic are known as black panthers.[PARAGRAPH:1]The species' success in the wild is in part due to its opportunistic hunting behavior, its adaptability to habitats, its ability to run at speeds approaching 58 kilometres per hour (36 mph), its unequaled ability to climb trees even when carrying a heavy carcass, and its notorious ability for stealth. The leopard consumes virtually any animal that it can hunt down and catch. Its habitat ranges from rainforest to desert terrains.[PARAGRAPH:1]It is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List because it is declining in large parts of its range due to habitat loss and fragmentation, and hunting for trade and pest control. It is regionally extinct in Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuwait, Syria, Libya and Tunisia.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_SANTA_MARIA_DEL_FIORE_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]Santa Maria del Fiore was built on the site of Florence's second cathedral dedicated to Saint Reparata; the first was the Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze whose first building was consecrated as a church in 393 by St. Ambrose of Milan. The ancient structure, founded in the early 5th century and having undergone many repairs, was crumbling with age, according to the 14th-century Nuova Cronica of Giovanni Villani, and was no longer large enough to serve the growing population of the city. Other major Tuscan cities had undertaken ambitious reconstructions of their cathedrals during the Late Medieval period, such as Pisa and particularly Siena where the enormous proposed extensions were never completed.[PARAGRAPH:2]The new church was designed by Arnolfo di Cambio and approved by city council in 1294. Di Cambio was also architect of the church of Santa Croce and the Palazzo Vecchio. He designed three wide naves ending under the octagonal dome, with the middle nave covering the area of Santa Reparata. The first stone was laid on 9 September 1296, by Cardinal Valeriana, the first papal legate ever sent to Florence. The building of this vast project was to last 140 years; Arnolfo's plan for the eastern end, although maintained in concept, was greatly expanded in size.[PARAGRAPH:2]After Arnolfo died in 1310, work on the cathedral slowed for thirty years. When the relics of Saint Zenobius were discovered in 1330 in Santa Reparata, the project gained a new impetus. In 1331, the Arte della Lana, the guild of wool merchants, took over patronage for the construction of the cathedral and in 1334 appointed Giotto to oversee the work. Assisted by Andrea Pisano, Giotto continued di Cambio's design. His major accomplishment was the building of the campanile. When Giotto died on 8 January 1337, Andrea Pisano continued the building until work was halted due to the Black Death in 1348.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1349, work resumed on the cathedral under a series of architects, starting with Francesco Talenti, who finished the campanile and enlarged the overall project to include the apse and the side chapels. In 1359, Talenti was succeeded by Giovanni di Lapo Ghini (1360-1369) who divided the center nave in four square bays. Other architects were Alberto Arnoldi, Giovanni d'Ambrogio, Neri di Fioravante and Andrea Orcagna. By 1375, the old church Santa Reparata was pulled down. The nave was finished by 1380, and by 1418, only the dome remained incomplete.[PARAGRAPH:2]On 18 August 1418, the Arte della Lana announced an architectural design competition for erecting Neri's dome. The two main competitors were two master goldsmiths, Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi, the latter of whom was supported by Cosimo de Medici. Ghiberti had been the winner of a competition for a pair of bronze doors for the Baptistery in 1401 and lifelong competition between the two remained sharp. Brunelleschi won and received the commission.[PARAGRAPH:2]Ghiberti, appointed coadjutator, drew a salary equal to Brunelleschi's and, though neither was awarded the announced prize of 200 florins, was promised equal credit, although he spent most of his time on other projects. When Brunelleschi became ill, or feigned illness, the project was briefly in the hands of Ghiberti. But Ghiberti soon had to admit that the whole project was beyond him. In 1423, Brunelleschi was back in charge and took over sole responsibility.[PARAGRAPH:2]Work started on the dome in 1420 and was completed in 1436. The cathedral was consecrated by Pope Eugene IV on 25 March 1436, (the first day of the year according to the Florentine calendar). It was the first 'octagonal' dome in history to be built without a temporary wooden supporting frame. It was one of the most impressive projects of the Renaissance. During the consecration in 1436, Guillaume Dufay's motet Nuper rosarum flores was performed. The structure of this motet was strongly influenced by the structure of the dome.[PARAGRAPH:2]The decoration of the exterior of the cathedral, begun in the 14th century, was not completed until 1887, when the polychrome marble fa&#231;ade was completed with the design of Emilio De Fabris. The floor of the church was relaid in marble tiles in the 16th century.[PARAGRAPH:2]The exterior walls are faced in alternate vertical and horizontal bands of polychrome marble from Carrara (white), Prato (green), Siena (red), Lavenza and a few other places. These marble bands had to repeat the already existing bands on the walls of the earlier adjacent baptistery the Battistero di San Giovanni and Giotto's Bell Tower. There are two side doors: the Doors of the Canonici (south side) and the Door of the Mandorla (north side) with sculptures by Nanni di Banco, Donatello, and Jacopo della Quercia. The six side windows, notable for their delicate tracery and ornaments, are separated by pilasters. Only the four windows closest to the transept admit light; the other two are merely ornamental. The clerestory windows are round, a common feature in Italian Gothic.[PARAGRAPH:2]During its long history, this cathedral has been the seat of the Council of Florence (1439), heard the preachings of Girolamo Savonarola and witnessed the murder of Giuliano di Piero de' Medici on Sunday, 26 April 1478 (with Lorenzo Il Magnifico barely escaping death), in the Pazzi conspiracy.</English>

		<Chinese>[表]圣玛利亚教堂建于佛罗伦萨第二座圣里帕拉塔大教堂的遗址上；第一座是圣洛伦佐大教堂，其第一座建筑于393年被米兰圣安布罗斯奉为教堂。据14世纪乔瓦尼·维拉尼（Giovanni Villani）的努瓦·克罗尼卡（Nuova Cronica）说，这座建于5世纪初并经过多次修缮的古老建筑随着时间的推移而逐渐坍塌，已经不足以满足这座城市不断增长的人口。其他主要的托斯卡纳城市在中世纪后期进行了雄心勃勃的重建教堂，例如比萨，特别是锡耶纳，那里的巨大扩建提议从未完成。〔2〕新教堂是由阿诺尔福迪坎比奥设计的，并于1294由市议会批准。迪坎比奥也是圣克罗齐教堂和维奇奥宫的建筑师。他设计了三个宽的中殿，在八角形穹顶下结束，中间的中殿覆盖了圣雷帕拉塔地区。第一块石头是1296年9月9日，由红衣主教瓦莱利亚纳，第一位教皇使节派往佛罗伦萨。这项浩瀚工程的建设已经持续了140年，Arnolfo的东端计划虽然在概念上保持了很大的发展，但在1310年阿诺尔福去世后，大教堂的工作放缓了三十年。1330年，圣泽诺比乌斯的遗迹在圣雷帕拉塔被发现，这项工程获得了新的动力。1331年，羊毛商协会（Arte della Lana）接管了大教堂建设的赞助权，1334年任命乔托监督这项工作。在安德里亚·皮萨诺的协助下，乔托继续设计迪坎比奥的作品。他的主要成就是建造了帐篷。当沢田家康于1337年1月8日去世时，Andrea Pisano继续建筑，直到1348黑死病停止工作。（1349段：2），在一系列建筑师的带领下，大教堂开始恢复工作，Francesco Talenti完成了钟楼并扩大了整个工程，包括了APSE和侧礼拜堂。1359年，塔伦蒂被乔瓦尼·迪·拉波·吉尼（1360-1369）继承，他将中殿分为四个方形隔间。其他建筑师有阿尔贝托·阿诺迪、乔瓦尼·德安布罗乔、尼里·迪菲奥拉万特和安德里亚·奥卡尼亚。1375年，圣里帕拉塔老教堂被拆毁。中殿于1380完工，到1418为止，只有圆顶保持不完整。1418年8月18日，Arte della Lana宣布了一个建筑设计竞赛，以建造Neri的穹顶。两位主要竞争对手是两位金匠大师洛伦佐·吉贝蒂和菲利波·布鲁内莱斯基，后者得到了科西莫·德梅迪奇的支持。吉贝蒂曾在1401年的一场洗礼会铜门比赛中获胜，两人的终身竞争依然激烈。布鲁内列奇赢得并获得了该委员会。[段：2 ]吉贝尔蒂，任命的协调员，得到了与布鲁内列斯奇相等的薪水，尽管两人都没有获得200弗洛林斯的宣布奖，但他承诺了同样的荣誉，尽管他把大部分时间都花在了其他项目上。当布鲁内莱斯基生病，或假装生病时，这个项目就在吉贝蒂手中。但吉贝蒂很快不得不承认，整个项目超出了他的能力范围。1423，Brunelleschi重新掌权，承担了唯一的责任。[段：2 ]在1420号圆顶上开始工作，并于1436完成。教皇尤金四世于1436年3月25日（根据佛罗伦萨历法，这是一年中的第一天）将大教堂神圣化。这是历史上第一个没有临时木制支撑框架的“八角形”穹顶。这是文艺复兴时期最令人印象深刻的工程之一。在1436年的献祭中，纪尧姆·杜菲的《努珀·罗莎姆·弗洛雷斯汽车旅馆》演出。这一节的结构受穹顶结构的影响很大。[段落：2 ]十四世纪开始的大教堂外部的装饰，直到1887，当彩饰大理石面漆是用Emilio De Fabris的设计完成的时候才损坏。教堂的地板在十六世纪的大理石瓷砖中被复制。[段落：2 ]外墙是由Carrara（白）、Prato（绿）、锡耶纳（红）、Lavenza和其他一些地方交替的垂直和水平的多色大理岩带构成的。这些大理石镶边必须重复先前相邻的洗礼院巴蒂斯特罗圣乔瓦尼和乔托钟楼墙壁上已有的镶边。有两扇侧门：Canonici（南面）门和Mandorla（北面）门，门上有Nanni di Banco、Donatello和Jacopo della Quercia的雕塑。六扇侧窗以其精致的窗花和装饰而著名，由壁柱隔开。只有最靠近耳堂的四扇窗户可以采光；另外两扇只是装饰性的。教堂的窗户是圆的，是意大利哥特式的一个共同特征。[段：2 ]在其悠久的历史中，这座大教堂一直是佛罗伦萨议会（1439）的所在地，听取了萨伏那洛拉的传言，并目睹了星期日吉利亚诺·迪·皮耶罗·德梅第奇的谋杀案。1478年4月26日（洛伦佐·伊尔·马菲尼科勉强逃脱死亡），在帕齐阴谋中。</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]The Babylonian Empire was, rather than a new idea, a reinvigoration of the old Sumerian Empire, which had also occupied what is today Southern Iraq. Babylonia was formed from a collection of roughly a dozen city states and was named for its capital city of Babylon. Originally a disorganized region, Babylon and Babylonia began to grow as a center for culture, trade, and religion under the rule of Hammurabi in 1728BC. Location of one of the seven ancient wonders - the Hanging Gardens - Babylonia became the jewel of the ancient world.[PARAGRAPH:2]Hammurabi was the first known ruler of united Babylonia as well as its greatest lawgiver. Hammurabi's Code of Laws regulated Babylonian life in such a way as to make the consequences of most criminal acts publicly known. Citizens could then structure their behavior based on these laws leading to a more organized society. So comprehensive was the Babylonian Code that little about its laws or governmental system changed in the entirety of its 1,200 years of existence. Babylon was so revered for this system that cities and states as far as the Mediterranean would emulate it for centuries.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the death of Hammurabi (1750 BC), the empire slowly declined in power and influence until it was eventually conquered by the Kassites (around 1600 BC) from what are now the mountains of Iran. The Kassites ruled over Babylonia for 576 years, reinvigorating the empire under their reign. Although Hammurabi ruled over Babylonia as a series of interconnected city states, the Kassites were the first rulers of Babylonia to transform the country into an organized territory. The Kassites created trade routes to countries as far away as Greece, Armenia and Turkey. Trade with these nations brought further wealth and status to Babylonia.[PARAGRAPH:2]Towards the end of the Kassite era of rule, Babylonia once again began to fall into decline, in part due to external political and military pressure. In 627 BC, the last Kassite ruler died, and Babylonia revolted under the command of a new leader, Nabopolassar. Nabopolassar's son, Nebuchadnezzar II, ruled Babylonia and brought about another golden era. During his rule, Babylonia became a military power, invading and taking territory in Egypt and Assyria. Not long afterwards, in 539 BC, Cyrus of Persia invaded Babylonia, conquering it, and forever ending Babylonia's existence as an independent territory.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite numerous regime changes, education reached exceptional heights among the Babylonians. Technical achievements such as the creation of a base 60, "sexigesimal," system of mathematics, are still used to this day. Sixty seconds per minute, sixty minutes per hour: modern time, is in fact, Babylonian time.[PARAGRAPH:2]Much like the Sumerian Empire from which they were descended, Babylonia was a nation of fanatical record-keepers. Starting with Hammurabi and continuing down until the empire's dissolution at the hands of Cyrus and the great Persian emperors, every financial transaction, every court verdict, every contract, and just about anything that could be written down, was - on clay tablets. With laws pertaining to almost every aspect of daily living, a significant amount of data was recorded, and much of this has been uncovered and excavated during the modern era. Researchers have even found several optical devices, similar to magnifying glasses, which were used to allow record keepers to write in smaller cuneiform, in order to fit more information on each clay tablet.[PARAGRAPH:2]Babylonia played an important role in the development of law throughout the world. The creation of Hammurabi's Code of Laws, and the zeal with which his successors, both blood-related and not, upheld those laws, demonstrated for all of history how successful and wealthy a nation could become by following an organized system of government.</English>

He was the eldest son of Prince Shirakabe (later known as Emperor Konin), and was born prior to Shirakabe's ascension to the throne. According to the Shoku Nihongi, Yamabe's mother, Yamato no Niigasa (later called Takano no Niigasa), was a descendant of King Muryeong of Baekje.[PARAGRAPH:2]After his father, Konin, became emperor, Kammu's half-brother Prince Osabe was appointed to the rank of crown prince. His mother Princess Inoe was a daughter of Emperor Shomu; but instead of Prince Osabe, it was Kammu who was later named to succeed their father. After Princess Inoe and Prince Osabe were confined and then died in 775, Prince Osabe's sister - Kammu's half-sister Princess Sakahito - became Kammu's wife. Later, when he ascended to the throne in 781, Kammu appointed his young brother, Prince Sawara, whose mother was Takano no Niigasa, as crown prince. Hikami no Kawatsugu, a son of Emperor Temmu's grandson Prince Shioyaki and Shomu's daughter Princess Fuwa, attempted to carry out a coup d'&#233;tat in 782, but it failed and Kawatsugu and his mother were sent into exile. In 785, Prince Sawara was expelled and died in exile.[PARAGRAPH:2]Kammu had 16 empresses and consorts, and 32 imperial sons and daughters. Among them, three sons would eventually ascend to the imperial throne: Emperor Heizei, Emperor Saga and Emperor Junna. Some of his descendants (known as the Kammu Taira or Kammu Heishi) took the Taira hereditary clan title, and in later generations became prominent warriors. Examples include Taira no Masakado, Taira no Kiyomori, and (with a further surname expansion) the Hojo clan. The waka poet Ariwara no Narihira was one of his grandsons.[PARAGRAPH:2]Emperor Kammu is traditionally venerated at his tomb; the Imperial Household Agency designates Kashiwabara no Misasagi, Kashiwabara Imperial Mausoleum), in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto, as the location of Kammu's mausoleum.[PARAGRAPH:2]Earlier Imperial sponsorship of Buddhism, beginning with Prince Shotoku (574-622), had led to a general politicization of the clergy, along with an increase in intrigue and corruption. In 784 Kammu shifted his capital from Nara to Nagaoka in a move that was said to be designed to edge the powerful Nara Buddhist establishments out of state politics-while the capital moved, the major Buddhist temples, and their officials, stayed put. Indeed there was a steady stream of edicts issued from 771 right through the period of Kukai's studies which, for instance, sought to limit the number of Buddhist priests, and the building of clan temples. However the move was to prove disastrous and was followed by a series of natural disasters including the flooding of half the city. In 785 the principal architect of the new capital, and royal favourite, Fujiwara no Tanetsugu, was assassinated.[PARAGRAPH:2]Meanwhile, Kammu's armies were pushing back the boundaries of his empire. This led to an uprising, and in 789 a substantial defeat for Kammu's troops. Also in 789 there was a severe drought and famine-the streets of the capital were clogged with the sick, and people avoiding being drafted into the military, or into forced labour. Many disguised themselves as Buddhist priests for the same reason. Then in 794 Kammu suddenly shifted the capital again, this time to Heian-kyo, which is modern day Kyoto. The new capital was started early the previous year, but the change was abrupt and led to even more confusion amongst the populace.[PARAGRAPH:2]Politically Kammu shored up his rule by changing the syllabus of the university. Confucian ideology still provided the raison d'etre for the Imperial government. In 784 Kammu authorised the teaching of a new course based on the Annals of Spring and Autumn based on two newly imported commentaries: Kung-yang, and Ku-liang. These commentaries used political rhetoric to promote a state in which the Emperor, as "Son of Heaven," should extend his sphere of influence to barbarous lands, thereby gladdening the people. In 798 the two commentaries became required reading at the government university.[PARAGRAPH:2]Kammu also sponsored the travels of the monks Saicho and Kukai to China, from where they returned to found the Japanese branches of, respectively, Tendai and Shingon Buddhism.</English>

Among them, three sons would eventually ascend to the imperial throne: Emperor Heizei, Emperor Saga and Emperor Junna. Some of his descendants (known as the Kammu Taira or Kammu Heishi) took the Taira hereditary clan title, and in later generations became prominent warriors. Examples include Taira no Masakado, Taira no Kiyomori, and (with a further surname expansion) the Hojo clan. The waka poet Ariwara no Narihira was one of his grandsons.[PARAGRAPH:1]Emperor Kammu is traditionally venerated at his tomb; the Imperial Household Agency designates Kashiwabara no Misasagi, Kashiwabara Imperial Mausoleum), in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto, as the location of Kammu's mausoleum.[PARAGRAPH:2]Earlier Imperial sponsorship of Buddhism, beginning with Prince Shotoku (574-622), had led to a general politicization of the clergy, along with an increase in intrigue and corruption. In 784 Kammu shifted his capital from Nara to Nagaoka in a move that was said to be designed to edge the powerful Nara Buddhist establishments out of state politics-while the capital moved, the major Buddhist temples, and their officials, stayed put. Indeed there was a steady stream of edicts issued from 771 right through the period of Kukai's studies which, for instance, sought to limit the number of Buddhist priests, and the building of clan temples. However the move was to prove disastrous and was followed by a series of natural disasters including the flooding of half the city. In 785 the principal architect of the new capital, and royal favourite, Fujiwara no Tanetsugu, was assassinated.[PARAGRAPH:1]Meanwhile, Kammu's armies were pushing back the boundaries of his empire. This led to an uprising, and in 789 a substantial defeat for Kammu's troops. Also in 789 there was a severe drought and famine-the streets of the capital were clogged with the sick, and people avoiding being drafted into the military, or into forced labour. Many disguised themselves as Buddhist priests for the same reason. Then in 794 Kammu suddenly shifted the capital again, this time to Heian-kyo, which is modern day Kyoto. The new capital was started early the previous year, but the change was abrupt and led to even more confusion amongst the populace.[PARAGRAPH:1]Politically Kammu shored up his rule by changing the syllabus of the university. Confucian ideology still provided the raison d'etre for the Imperial government. In 784 Kammu authorised the teaching of a new course based on the Annals of Spring and Autumn based on two newly imported commentaries: Kung-yang, and Ku-liang. These commentaries used political rhetoric to promote a state in which the Emperor, as "Son of Heaven," should extendnd his sphere of influence to barbarous lands, thereby gladdening the people. In 798 the two commentaries became required reading at the government university.[PARAGRAPH:1]Kammu also sponsored the travels of the monks Saicho and Kukai to China, from where they returned to found the Japanese branches of, respectively, Tendai and Shingon Buddhism.</Chinese>

It had no central administration, student registers, or prescribed courses of study: instead, it was composed of many entirely independent colleges, each run by a single "imam" (scholar). Students associated themselves with an imam (rather than with a subject or department) and instruction was often carried out on an individual basis. Anyone could establish a college if he so wished; not surprisingly, the quality of the different schools was said to be very uneven.[PARAGRAPH:1]Courses took place in the open courtyards of mosques or in private homes. The primary focus of the university was study of the Qur'an, although some imams gave lessons in history, astronomy, and logic. Scholars were encouraged to write their own books because it was profitable to do so - in the Islamic world at that time, books commanded a much higher price than gold or slaves.

The neo-Gothic church was erected by worshipers between 1916 and 1953 and replaced a shrine first built in the mid-18th century.[PARAGRAPH:2]According to popular belief, the Virgin Mary appeared to a woman and her deaf-mute daughter in 1754 at exactly the same place where the church is now standing. The woman, Maria Meneses de Qui&#241;ones, and her daughter, Rosa, were passing by the Guaitara river when they found themselves hiding from a storm.

When Rosa died, Mueces returned to the place where they had seen Virgin Mary to pray for her daughter's soul. The virgin then miraculously revived Rosa, and mother and daughter could no longer keep the miracle a secret. The first shrine in the honor of Jesus's mother was built a few years after the alleged appearance, according to the journal of a friar who was traveling the region between 1756 and 1764. Half a century later, in 1802, a bigger shrine was built and worshipers erected the first version of the bridge that now allows access to the church.[PARAGRAPH:2]The miraculous appearing of the virgin is only the first of a number of legends and mysteries linked to the Las Lajas Sanctuary. For example, nobody knows who made the image of the Virgin Mary that is at the end of the church, behind the altar.

		<English>[TAB]Artificial satellites are spacecraft that maintain an orbit around a celestial body. What differentiates an orbit from other types of space flight is it doesn't require any additional propulsion. Satellites can hold a number of different orbits. One type is a polar orbit, which causes the spacecraft to pass over the north and south poles. Another is an equatorial orbit, which causes the satellite to circle the Earth's equator. The farther the orbit from the surface of the earth, the longer it takes to complete a circuit of the earth. If the vessel uses an equatorial orbit at a distance of 22,300 miles from Earth, it can achieve geo-synchronous orbit, which causes the satellite to remain stationary over a specific area. </English>

He fought several successful campaigns against the Moors and, on July 26, 1139, he obtained an overwhelming victory in the Battle of Ourique, and straight after was unanimously proclaimed King of Portugal by his soldiers. This meant that Portugal was no longer a vassal county of Leon-Castile, but an independent kingdom in its own right. Next, he assembled the first assembly of the estates-general at Lamego, where he was given the crown from the archbishop of Braga, to confirm the independence.[PARAGRAPH:2]Independence, however, was not a thing a land could choose on its own. Portugal still had to be acknowledged by the neighbouring lands and, most importantly, by the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope. Afonso wedded Mafalda of Savoy, daughter of Count Amadeo III of Savoy, and sent Ambassadors to Rome to negotiate with the Pope. In Portugal, he built several monasteries and convents and bestowed important privileges to religious orders. In 1143, he wrote to Pope Innocent II to declare himself and the kingdom servants of the Church, swearing to pursue driving the Moors out of the Iberian peninsula. Bypassing any king of Castile or Leon. Afonso declared himself the direct liegeman of the Papacy. Thus, Afonso continued to distinguish himself by his exploits against the Moors, from whom he wrested Santar&#233;m&#160;and Lisbon in 1147. He also conquered an important part of the land south of the Tagus River, although this was lost again to the Moors in the following years.[PARAGRAPH:2]Meanwhile, King Alfonso VII of Castile (Afonso's cousin) regarded the independent ruler of Portugal as nothing but a rebel. Conflict between the two was constant and bitter in the following years. Afonso became involved in a war, taking the side of the Aragonese king, an enemy of Castile. To ensure the alliance, his son Sancho was engaged to Dulce Berenguer, sister of the Count of Barcelona, and princess of Aragon. Finally, in 1143, the Treaty of Zamora established peace between the cousins and the recognition by the Kingdom of Castile and Leon that Portugal was an independent kingdom.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1179 the privileges and favours given to the Roman Catholic Church were compensated. In the papal bull "Manifestis Probatum", Pope Alexander III acknowledged Afonso as King and Portugal as an independent land with the right to conquer lands from the Moors. With this papal blessing, Portugal was at last secured as a country and safe from any Castilian attempts of annexation.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1184, in spite of his great age, he had still sufficient energy to relieve his son Sancho, who was besieged in Santar&#233;m by the Moors. He died shortly after, in 1185.[NEWLINE]The Portuguese revere him as a hero, both on account of his personal character and as the founder of their nation.</English>

Invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century, the early printing presses used a flat tray of inked type. Once paper was placed over the type, a surface was applied and the ink was pressed into the paper. While an improvement over the traditional duplication methods of the time (being meticulous hand-scribing of volumes), it was a slow and tedious process to use. Around 1800 the first cylinder press was created, followed by the large and immensely fast rotary presses.[PARAGRAPH:2]Today, computers have taken this ancient art out of the craftsman's workshop and placed it on the desktop.

He is the third ruler of the Tuluva Dynasty. Presiding over the empire at its zenith, he is regarded as an icon by many Indians. Krishna Deva Raya earned the titles Kannada Rajya Rama Ramana (lit, "Lord of the Kannada empire"), Andhra Bhoja and Mooru Rayara Ganda (lit, "King of three Kings"). He became the dominant ruler of the peninsula of India by defeating the Sultans of Bijapur, Golconda, the Bahmani Sultanate and the Raja of Odisha. The great south Indian mathematician Nilakantha Somayaji also lived in the Empire of Krishnadevaraya. He was the most powerful of all the Hindu rulers of India. Indeed, when the Mughal Babur was taking stock of the potentates of north India, Krishnadevaraya was rated the most powerful and had the most extensive empire in the subcontinent.[PARAGRAPH:2]Portuguese travellers Domingo Paes and Fernao Nuniz also visited the Vijayanagara Empire during his reign. Krishna Deva Raya benefited from the able prime minister Timmarusu, who was regarded by the emperor as a father figure and was responsible for his coronation. Krishna Deva Raya was the son of Tuluva Narasa Nayaka, an army commander under Saluva Narasimha Deva Raya, who later took control of the empire to prevent its disintegration and became the founder of the Tuluva Dynasty, the third Hindu Dynasty to rule Vijayanagara. The emperor's coronation took place on the birthday of Hindu God Krishna. He built a beautiful suburb near Vijayanagara called Nagalapura. The king was of medium height, had a cheerful disposition, and was reputed to be respectful to foreign visitors, ruthless in maintaining the law, and prone to fits of anger. He maintained himself to a high level of physical fitness through daily exercises. Travelogues indicate that the king was not only an able administrator, but also an excellent general, leading from the front in battle and even attending to the wounded. The south Indian poet Muku Timmana praised him as the destroyer of the Turks.</English>

		<English>[TAB]When discovered, paper revolutionized information technology. Before the advent of paper, scholars and writers used a number of different materials upon which to record their words. These included clay tablets, animal skins, silk, and others. These suffered from many shortcomings. Clay was bulky and fragile, animal skins were expensive, silk was expensive and fragile, and so forth - and none of them would have been suitable for use in a printing press.[PARAGRAPH:2]Papyrus was the earliest form of paper. It was created by cutting the stem of the papyrus plant into strips, which were laid in an overlapping pattern and pounded into a sheet. The material was then dried and polished. While serviceable, the resulting sheet is fairly thick and, more importantly, subject to rot in damp climates.[PARAGRAPH:2]Paper as we know it today was invented in China in around 100 AD. Wood and other fibrous material is mixed with liquid and mashed into a pulp, which is then poured onto fine screens. The liquid drains away, leaving a thin layer of fibrous material on the wire. When this material dries, it becomes paper. The Chinese official Cai Lun is credited with adding cotton rags to the pulp; the resulting paper was far sturdier than earlier versions. The Chinese process spread slowly throughout the world, reaching Europe around 1300 AD.[PARAGRAPH:2]When paired with the printing press - yet another Chinese invention - paper exponentially increased the spread of information and art.</English>

Most Ptolemeis spoke Greek and refused to learn Egyptian, which is the reason that Greek as well as Egyptian languages were used on official court documents like the Rosetta Stone. By contrast, Cleopatra learned Egyptian and represented herself as the reincarnation of an Egyptian Goddess.[PARAGRAPH:2]Cleopatra originally ruled jointly with her father Ptolemy XII Auletes and later with her brothers, Ptolemy XIII and Ptolemy XIV, whom she married as per Egyptian custom, but eventually she became sole ruler. As pharaoh, she consummated a liaison with Gaius Julius Caesar that solidified her grip on the throne. She later elevated her son with Caesar, Caesarion, to co-ruler in name.[PARAGRAPH:2]After Caesar's assassination in 44 BC, she aligned with Mark Antony in opposition to Caesar's legal heir, Gaius Iulius Caesar Octavianus (later known as Augustus). With Antony, she bore the twins Cleopatra Selene II and Alexander Helios, and another son, Ptolemy Philadelphus. Her unions with her brothers produced no children. After losing the Battle of Actium to Octavian's forces, Antony committed suicide. Cleopatra followed suit, according to tradition killing herself by means of an asp bite on August 12, 30 BC. She was briefly outlived by Caesarion, who was declared pharaoh, but he was soon killed on Octavian's orders. Egypt became the Roman province of Aegyptus.[PARAGRAPH:2]Though Cleopatra bore the ancient Egyptian title of pharaoh, the Ptolemaic dynasty was Hellenistic, having been founded 300 years before by Ptolemy I Soter, a Macedonian Greek general of Alexander the Great. As such, Cleopatra's language was the Greek spoken by the Hellenic aristocracy, though she was reputed to be the first ruler of the dynasty to learn Egyptian. She also adopted common Egyptian beliefs and deities. Her patron goddess was Isis, and thus, during her reign, it was believed that she was the re-incarnation and embodiment of the goddess of wisdom. Her death marked the end of the Ptolemaic Kingdom and Hellenistic period and the beginning of the Roman era in the eastern Mediterranean.[PARAGRAPH:2]To this day, Cleopatra remains a popular figure in Western culture. Her legacy survives in numerous works of art and the many dramatizations of her story in literature and other media, including William Shakespeare's tragedy Antony and Cleopatra, Jules Massenet's opera Cl&#233;op&#226;tre and the 1963 film Cleopatra. In most depictions, Cleopatra is put forward as a great beauty and her successive conquests of the world's most powerful men are taken to be proof of her aesthetic and sexual appeal. In his Pens&#233;es, philosopher Blaise Pascal contends that Cleopatra's classically beautiful profile changed world history: "Cleopatra's nose, had it been shorter, the whole face of the world would have been changed.</English>

The founder of the Dynasty of Akkad, Sargon reigned during the last quarter of the third millennium BC. Cuneiform sources agree that he was cup-bearer (official in charge of wine) of king Ur-Zababa of Kish, and some later historians have speculated that he killed the king and usurped his throne before embarking on the quest to conquer Mesopotamia. He was originally referred to as Sargon I until records concerning an Assyrian king also named Sargon (now usually referred to as Sargon I) were unearthed.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sargon's vast empire is thought to have included large parts of Mesopotamia, and included parts of modern-day Iran, Asia Minor and Syria. He ruled from a new, but as yet archaeologically unidentified capital, Akkad, which the Sumerian king list claims he built (or possibly renovated). He is sometimes regarded as the first person in recorded history to create a multiethnic, centrally ruled empire, although the Sumerians Lugal-anne-mundu and Lugal-zage-si also have a claim. His dynasty controlled Mesopotamia for around a century and a half (150 years).</English>

		<English>[H1]Francisco Franco Bahamonde[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Head of the Spanish State[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1892 - 1975 AD[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1] Franco led a successful military career and reached the rank of General. He fought in Morocco and suppressed a strike in 1934 to defend the Republican government's stability. In February 1936, the left-wing Popular Front won the general election and formed a government. A period of severe instability and disarray followed the election, with escalating violence between left and right wing supporters. Anti-clerical violence against the Church by leftist militants further raised tensions. After the assassination of a major opposition figure, Jos&#233; Calvo Sotelo, by a commando unit of the Assault Guards in July 1936, Franco participated in a coup d'etat against the elected Popular Front government. The coup failed and evolved into the Spanish Civil War during which he emerged as the leader of the Nationalists against the Popular Front. After winning the civil war, he dissolved the Spanish Parliament, establishing an authoritarian regime that lasted until 1978, when a new constitution was drafted. During the Second World War, Franco maintained a policy of neutrality, although he did assist Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy on a small scale against the Soviet Union, most famously by sending troops (known as the Blue Division) to aid Nazi Germany in fighting the USSR. Before the invasion of the Soviet Union by the German Army, Franco and Hitler met in Hendaye on October 23, 1940. During the Cold War, the United States established a diplomatic alliance with Franco, due to his strong anti-Communist policy. American President Richard Nixon toasted Franco, and, after Franco's death, stated: "General Franco was a loyal friend and ally of the United States." After his death Spain began a transition to democracy.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Civil War had ravaged the Spanish economy. Infrastructure had been damaged, workers killed, and daily business severely hampered. For more than a decade after Franco's victory, the economy improved little. Franco initially pursued a policy of autarky, cutting off almost all international trade. The policy had devastating effects, and the economy stagnated. Economic growth picked up in 1959 after Franco took authority away from ideologues and gave more power to apolitical technocrats. The country implemented several development policies and growth took off creating the "Spanish Miracle". During the 1960s, the wealthy classes of Francoist Spain's population experienced further increases in wealth. It had the second-fastest growing economy in the world (the fastest being Japan). At the time of Franco's death, Spain still lagged behind most of Western Europe, but the gap between its GDP per capita and that of Western Europe had narrowed. After periods of rapid growth during the late 1980s and late 1990s, Spain now only lags slightly behind the economies of Britain, Ireland,France and Germany, and has now overtaken Italy on some measures.[PARAGRAPH:2]Spain attempted to retain control of its colonial empire throughout Franco's rule. During the Algerian War (1954-62), Madrid became the base of the Organisation de l'arm&#233;e secr&#232;te (OAS) right-wing French Army group which sought to preserve French Algeria. Despite this, Franco was forced to make some concessions. Henceforth, when French Morocco became independent in 1956, he surrendered Spanish Morocco to Mohammed V, retaining only a few enclaves (the Plazas de soberan&#237;a). The year after, Mohammed V invaded Spanish Sahara during the Ifni War (known as the "Forgotten War" in Spain). Only in 1975, with the Green March, did Morocco take control of all of the former Spanish territories in the Sahara.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1968, due to United Nations' pressure, Franco granted Spain's colony of Equatorial Guinea its independence, and the next year, ceded the exclave of Ifni to Morocco. Under Franco, Spain also pursued a campaign to gain sovereignty of the British overseas territory of Gibraltar, and closed its border with Gibraltar in 1969. The border would not be fully reopened until 1985.[PARAGRAPH:2]In Spain and abroad, the legacy of Franco remains controversial. Symbols of the Franco regime (such as the national flag with the Imperial Eagle) are now banned by law, while the national anthem of Spain, the Marcha Real, is no longer accompanied by the lyrics introduced by Franco.</English>

		<Chinese>[H1]西班牙国家[Brang] [Brut]头[\Brut] [NealLe] [Brd]：[\BOLD ] 1892到1975 AD [NealLe] [NealLe] [Brut]背景：[Brd]（段落：1）Franco领导了成功的军事生涯并达到了将军的地位。他在摩洛哥作战，并于1934年镇压了一次罢工，以捍卫共和政府的稳定。1936年2月，左翼人民阵线赢得大选，组建政府。选举之后出现了一段严重的不稳定和混乱时期，左翼和右翼支持者之间的暴力不断升级。左派激进分子针对教会的反教士暴力进一步加剧了紧张局势。1936年7月，一名主要的反对派人物何塞·卡尔沃·索泰洛（JoséCalvo Sotelo）被突击卫队突击队暗杀后，佛朗哥参加了一场反对民选人民阵线政府的政变。政变失败，演变成西班牙内战，期间他成为反对人民阵线的民族主义者领袖。赢得内战后，他解散了西班牙议会，建立了一个独裁政权，一直持续到1978年新宪法起草时。在第二次世界大战期间，佛朗哥保持中立政策，尽管他在小范围内帮助纳粹德国和法西斯意大利对抗苏联，最著名的是派遣军队（称为蓝师）帮助纳粹德国与苏联作战。1940年10月23日，德军入侵苏联前，弗朗哥和希特勒在亨达耶会晤。冷战期间，由于弗朗哥强烈的反共政策，美国与他建立了外交联盟。美国总统理查德·尼克松向Franco致敬，在Franco去世后，他说：“Franco将军是美国忠实的朋友和盟友。”在他死后，西班牙开始向民主过渡。[第2段]内战蹂躏了西班牙经济。基础设施遭到破坏，工人丧生，日常业务严重受阻。佛朗哥获胜十多年来，经济几乎没有改善。佛朗哥最初奉行自给自足的政策，切断了几乎所有的国际贸易。这项政策产生了毁灭性的影响，经济停滞不前。1959年，佛朗哥从理论家手中夺走权力，把更多权力交给了非政治的技术官僚，经济增长开始回升。国家实施了多项发展政策，经济增长创造了“西班牙奇迹”。20世纪60年代，西班牙佛朗哥主义者的富裕阶层财富进一步增加。它拥有世界上第二快的经济增长（最快的是日本）。佛朗哥去世时，西班牙仍落后于西欧大部分地区，但人均国内生产总值与西欧的差距已经缩小。在上世纪80年代末和90年代末的快速增长之后，西班牙现在只落后于英国、爱尔兰、法国和德国的经济，现在已经超过了意大利的某些措施。[段落：2 ]西班牙试图在Franco统治下保持对其殖民帝国的控制。在阿尔及利亚战争期间（1954-62年），马德里成为法国右翼武装组织（OAS）的基地，该组织试图保护法属阿尔及利亚。尽管如此，佛朗哥还是被迫做出了一些让步。此后，1956年法属摩洛哥独立，他将西班牙摩洛哥交给穆罕默德五世，只保留了几个飞地（苏伯拉尼亚广场）。第二年，穆罕默德五世在伊夫尼战争（在西班牙被称为“被遗忘的战争”）中入侵西班牙撒哈拉。仅在1975，随着绿色游行，摩洛哥控制了撒哈拉以前所有西班牙领地。[第1968段]，由于联合国的压力，Franco授予西班牙殖民地赤道几内亚的独立权，并在第二年将Ifni的飞地割让给摩洛哥。在佛朗哥的领导下，西班牙还开展了争取英国海外领土直布罗陀主权的运动，并于1969年关闭了与直布罗陀的边界。直到1985，边界才完全开放。[段：2 ]在西班牙和国外，法兰克遗产仍然存在争议。佛朗哥政权的象征（如带有帝国鹰的国旗）现在已被法律禁止，而西班牙国歌《玛莎·雷亚尔》（Marcha Real）则不再配以佛朗哥介绍的歌词。</Chinese>

Suleiman's conquests reached from Baghdad to Egypt, making the Ottoman Empire the main channel through which the riches of the east could reach Europe. Ottoman naval supremacy in the Mediterranean further aided Suleiman's economic empire, the corsair Barbarossa sending innumerable European ships to the sea floor.[PARAGRAPH:2]It was this penchant for expansionism that struck fear into the heart of Europe. The Sultan's push northward took him as far as Hungary, where he found his progress stalled by the Hapsburg ruler Archduke Ferdinand I.[PARAGRAPH:2]While his territorial accomplishments were impressive, the Sultan did not ignore the culture of his homeland, Suleiman himself a skilled poet and fervent Muslim. Towards the end of his reign, Suleiman commissioned numerous new mosques of a previously unseen grandeur, designed by master architect, Sinan.[PARAGRAPH:2]Suleiman became well known in both the Christian west and the Muslim east, but for strikingly different reasons. Most Europeans envied the Sultan for the sheer opulence in which he lived. Celebrations of a previously unheard of grandeur were held at the Hippodrome in Istanbul. Rooms covered in gold, gems and the finest tapestries could be seen throughout the Sultan's palace at Topkapi.[PARAGRAPH:2]Muslims, on the other hand, respected the Sultan for his belief in the rule of law. The Sultan adopted Islamic sacred law to compliment the traditional law already in place from his predecessors.

He became the first king of the Tu'i Tonga (Tonga king) dynasty in the early 10th century, dethroning the previous one with the same name but originating from the uanga (maggots) instead of divine.[PARAGRAPH:2]When 'Aho'eitu was growing up he asked his mother about his father. His mother was a human woman from an area now known as Popua near the large lagoon of Tongatapu island. Aho eitu's mother told him that his father was a god living in the sky. When he had grown up he expressed the wish to find him. 'Ilaheva directed him to the great toa tree. The lad climbed up, went over the road as his mother had said and found his father catching doves. 'Eitumatupu'a was moved to see his son, and invited him to his house for kava and food. After that he sent him to his other sons, 'Aho'eitu's older halfbrothers, who were living in the sky, and at that moment playing sika-'ulu-toa (a dart throwing game with reeds having a head made from toa wood). When those young men found out that this good-looking boy was their brother, they got jealous, tore him in pieces, cooked him (or did not cook him, according to some sources) and ate him. Except his head, which was thrown in some hoi plants which have become poisonous ever since.[PARAGRAPH:2]Some time after 'Eitumatupu'a sent a woman to fetch 'Aho'eitu, but she returned with the message that the lad was not to be found. The god demanded his other sons to come and forced them by tickling their throats to vomit in a large wooden bowl. Noticing the head missing, 'Eitumatupu'a sent a messenger to find the head and also the bones. Everything was put in the bowl. Water was poured on it and the leaves of the nonufiafia, which is a known medicinal plant, able to revive people who were near death. The bowl then was put behind the house. They visited it from time to time, and at last they found 'Aho'eitu sitting up.[PARAGRAPH:2]They all were brought into 'Eitumatupu'a's house, and the god spoke angrily to his elder sons that they were murderers and that for punishment they had to stay in the sky, while 'Aho'eitu would descend to become king of Tonga. But now his older brothers repented and begged their father that they would be allowed to follow him. At last the god gave in, but stipulated that, even though they were older, they would become servants to 'Aho'eitu.</English>

		<English>[H1]Dona Maria II[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Queen Regent of Portugal and the Algarves[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1819 - 1853 AD[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Dona Maria II was Queen regnant of Portugal from 1826 to 1828 and later from 1834 to 1853. She was the second Queen regnant of Portugal and the Algarves, and the 29th or 30th Portuguese monarch. She was a member of the House of Braganza.[NEWLINE]Born as Maria da Gl&#243;ria Joana Carlota Leopoldina da Cruz Francisca Xavier de Paula Isidora Micaela Gabriela Rafaela Gonzaga, Maria da Gl&#243;ria was the daughter of the future King of Portugal and first Emperor of Brazil, Peter IV and his first wife Maria Leopoldina, Archduchess of Austria, herself a daughter of Emperor Francis II. Born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Maria is the only European monarch to not have been born in Europe.[PARAGRAPH:2]When Maria's grandfather King John VI died in March 1826, there was a succession crisis in Portugal. The king had a male heir, Peter, but Peter had proclaimed the independence of Brazil in 1822 and he was then Emperor Peter I of that country. The late king also had a younger son, Miguel, but he was exiled in Austria after leading a number of revolutions against his father and his liberal regime.[NEWLINE]Before his death, the king had nominated his favourite granddaughter, Isabel Maria, to serve as regent until "the legitimate heir returned to the Kingdom" but he had failed to specify which of his sons was the legitimate heir. Peter, the liberal Emperor of Brazil, or Miguel, the absolutist exiled prince?[PARAGRAPH:2]Most people considered Peter to be the legitimate heir, but nobody wanted him to unite Portugal and Brazil's thrones again. The European country had been under Brazilian rule when both were part of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, established by the King John VI during his stay in Rio de Janeiro from 1808 until 1820. Aware that his brother's supporters were ready to bring Miguel back and put him in the throne, Peter decided for a more consensual option; he abdicated the throne to his eldest daughter, Maria da Glria (who was only seven years old), and she should marry her uncle Miguel, who should accept the liberal constitution and act as a regent until his niece was an adult.[PARAGRAPH:2]Miguel pretended to accept, but when he arrived in Portugal he deposed Maria and proclaimed himself King, abrogating the liberal constitution in the process. During his reign of terror, Maria traveled to many European courts, including her grandfather's in Vienna, as well as London and Paris.[PARAGRAPH:2]Peter abdicated the Brazilian throne in 1831 in favor of his son (and Maria's younger brother, Peter II), and from his base in the Azores he attacked Miguel, forcing him to abdicate in 1834. Maria was thereupon restored to the throne, and obtained an annulment of her betrothal.[PARAGRAPH:2]On January 26, 1835 she married (at the age of fifteen) to Auguste, Duke of Leuchtenberg, son of Eugne de Beauharnais, and grandson of Empress Josephine. However, he died only two months later on March 28, 1835.[PARAGRAPH:2]On January 1, 1836 Maria married again, to the cultured and able Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, who ruled with her as a co-monarch. He received the title of King in 1837, in accordance with Portuguese custom, upon the birth of their first child Peter, an heir to the throne.[PARAGRAPH:2]Maria's reign saw a revolutionary insurrection on May 16, 1846, but this was crushed by royalist troops on February 22, 1847, and Portugal otherwise avoided the European upheavals of 1848. Maria's reign was also notable for a public health act aimed at curbing the spread of cholera throughout the country. She also pursued policies aimed at raising the levels of education throughout the country.[PARAGRAPH:2]After constant pregnancies and births, doctors warned Maria of the dangers of giving birth nearly every year. However, she ignored the risks that had killed her mother, who had died of complications following a miscarriage after many births; "If I die, I die at my post", Maria said. In 1853 she died while giving birth to her eleventh child, Prince Eugene, who also died.[PARAGRAPH:2]Maria II is remembered as a good mother and a kind person, who always acted according to her convictions in the attempt to help her country. She was later given the surname "The Good Mother." Also, in 1842, Pope Gregory XVI presented Maria with a Golden Rose.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The earliest practical use of chemical processes was by metal smiths of the ancient world. These artisans learned how to use heat to melt various naturally occurring metals together to form alloys such as bronze. Early manufacturers of cloth also used primitive chemical processes to set dyes. In the following centuries, chemical processes were studied through the pseudo-science of alchemy, which attempted to change base metals into gold. Although alchemists were, of course, unsuccessful, they did develop many valuable chemical processes as a result.[PARAGRAPH:2]The manuscripts produced by alchemists were studied by succeeding generations, and an effective knowledge of chemistry had been accumulated by the late 13th century. In the 17th century, the ideas of alchemy finally died out as an increasing body of true chemical knowledge was gained through experimental analysis, leading to the modern science of chemistry.</English>

		<English>[TAB]For much of human history, victory has gone to those with access to the finest metals. From the Bronze Age onwards, metal tools, weapons and alloys have been an inherent part of the rise of civilization, spurring conquests and construction by the world's greatest empires. And while metal mining has had an impressive history, it was not until the nineteenth century that industrial mining truly began to take root.[PARAGRAPH:1]Two reasons explain this sudden intensification in mining operations. The first was the almost daily revolutions in the production of tools and consumer items, requiring a continual source of metal to produce them. The second was that the fuel that powered the Industrial Revolution was coal, nestled deep within the earth. In modern times, enormous excavators like the Bagger 288 have it possible to mine a pit three-hundred feet long and one-hundred feet deep in a day, a feat that, in the past, would have required the mobilization of nations.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The practice of communication by written documents carried by an intermediary from one person or place to another almost certainly dates back nearly to the invention of writing. However, development of formal postal systems occurred much later. The first documented use of an organized courier service for the diffusion of written documents is in Egypt, where Pharaohs used couriers for the diffusion of their decrees in the territory of the State (2400 BC).[PARAGRAPH:2]The first credible claim for the development of a real postal system comes from Ancient Persia but the point of invention remains in question. The best documented claim (Xenophon) attributes the invention to the Persian King Cyrus the Great (550 BC), while other writers credit his successor Darius I of Persia (521 BC). Other sources claim much earlier dates for an Assyrian postal system, with credit given to Hammurabi (1700 BC) and Sargon II (722 BC). Mail may not have been the primary mission of this postal service, however. The role of the system as an intelligence gathering apparatus is well documented, and the service was (later) called angariae, a term that in time turned to indicate a tax system. The Old Testament (Esther, VIII) makes mention of this system: Ahasuerus, king of Medes, used couriers for communicating his decisions.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Persian system worked on stations (called Chapar-Khaneh), where the message carrier (called Chapar) would ride to the next post, whereupon he would swap his horse with a fresh one, for maximum performance and delivery speed. Herodotus described the system in this way: "It is said that as many days as there are in the whole journey, so many are the men and horses that stand along the road, each horse and man at the interval of a day's journey; and these are stayed neither by snow nor rain nor heat nor darkness from accomplishing their appointed course with all speed".[PARAGRAPH:2]The economic growth and political stability under the Mauryan empire (322-185 BC) saw the development of impressive civil infrastructure in ancient India. The Mauryans developed early Indian mail service as well as public wells, rest houses and other facilities for the common public. Common chariots called Dagana were sometimes used as mail chariots in ancient India.[PARAGRAPH:2]In ancient times the kings, emperors, rulers, zamindars or the feudal lords protected their land through the intelligence services of specially trained police or military agencies and courier services to convey and obtain information through runners, messengers and even through pigeons. The chief of the secret service, known as the postmaster, maintained the lines of communication... The people used to send letters to their distant relatives through their friends or neighbors.[PARAGRAPH:2]Early stamps of India were watermarked with an elephant's head. [PARAGRAPH:2]In South India, the Wodeyar dynasty (1399 - 1947) of the Kingdom of Mysore used mail service for espionage purposes thereby acquiring knowledge related to matters that took place at great distances.[PARAGRAPH:2]By the end of the 18th century the postal system in India had reached impressive levels of efficiency. According to British national Thomas Broughton, the Maharaja of Jodhpur sent daily offerings of fresh flowers from his capital to Nathadvara (320 km) and they arrived in time for the first religious Darshan at sunrise. Later this system underwent complete modernization when the British Raj established its full control over India. The Post Office Act XVII of 1837 provided that the Governor-General of India in Council had the exclusive right of conveying letters by post for hire within the territories of the East India Company. The mails were available to certain officials without charge, which became a controversial privilege as the years passed. On this basis the Indian Post Office was established on October 1, 1837.[PARAGRAPH:2]China enjoyed postal relay stations since the Han dynasty (206 BC-220 AD). During the Yuan Dynasty under Kublai Khan, China was integrated into the much larger &#214;rt&#246;&#246; system of the Mongol Empire.[PARAGRAPH:2]The first well documented postal service is that of Rome. Organized at the time of Augustus Caesar (62 BC-AD 14), it may also be the first true mail service. The service was called cursus publicus and was provided with light carriages called rhed脙娄 with fast horses. Additionally, there was another slower service equipped with two-wheeled carts (birol脙娄) pulled by oxen. This service was reserved for government correspondence. Another service for citizens was later added.[PARAGRAPH:2]Genghis Khan installed an empire-wide messenger and postal station system named &#214;rt&#246;&#246; within the Mongol Empire. During the Yuan Dynasty under Kublai Khan, this system also covered the territory of China. Postal stations were used not only for the transmission and delivery of official mail, but were also available for traveling officials, military men, and foreign dignitaries. These stations aided and facilitated the transport of foreign and domestic tribute, and trade in general. By the end of Kublai Khan's rule there were more than 1400 postal stations in China alone, which in turn had at their disposal about 50000 horses, 1400 oxen, 6700 mules, 400 carts, 6000 boats, over 200 dogs and 1150 sheep.[PARAGRAPH:2]The stations were 15 to 40 miles apart and had reliable attendants working for the mail service. Foreign observers, such as Marco Polo have attested to the efficiency of this early postal system.[PARAGRAPH:2]Another important postal service was created in the Islamic world by the caliph Mu'awiyya; the service was called barid, by the name of the towers built to protect the roads by which couriers travelled.[PARAGRAPH:2]Well before the Middle Ages and during them, homing pigeons were used for pigeon post, taking advantage of a singular quality of this bird, which when taken far from its nest is able to find his way home due to a particularly developed sense of orientation. Messages were then tied around the legs of the pigeon, which was freed and could reach his original nest.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mail has been transported by quite a few other methods throughout history, including dogsled, balloon, rocket, mule, pneumatic tubes and even submarine.[PARAGRAPH:2]Many religious orders had a private mail service, notably Cistercians ' one connected more than 6,000 abbeys, monasteries and churches. The best organization however was created by the Knights Templar. The newly instituted universities too had their private services, starting from Bologna (1158).[PARAGRAPH:2]Popular illiteracy was accommodated through the service of scribes. Illiterates who needed to communicate dictated their messages to a scribe, another profession now quite generally disappeared.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1505, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I established a postal system in the Empire, appointing Franz von Thurn und Taxis to run it. The Thurn and Taxis family, then known as Tassis, had operated postal services between Italian city states from 1290 onwards. Following the abolition of the Empire in 1806 the Thurn and Taxis postal system continued as a private organisation, continuing to exist into the postage stamp era before finally being absorbed into the postal system of the new German Empire after 1871.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the United Kingdom, prior to 1840 the postal system was expensive, confusing and seen as corrupt. Letters were paid for by the recipient rather than the sender, and were charged according to the distance the letter had travelled and the number of sheets of paper it contained. If there is one man who can be said to have changed the face of the postal service forever it is Sir Rowland Hill, with his reforms of the postal system based on the concept of penny postage, and his solution of pre payment. In his proposal Hill also called for official pre-printed envelopes and adhesive postage stamps as alternative ways of getting the sender to pay for the postage, at a time when prepayment was optional, which led to the invention of the postage stamp, the Penny Black.[PARAGRAPH:2]It was around this time nationalization and centralization of most postal systems took place. Today, the study of mail systems is known as postal history.[PARAGRAPH:2]The postal system was important in the development of modern transportation. Railroads carried railway post offices. During the 20th century, air mail became the transport of choice for inter-continental mail. Postmen started to utilize mail trucks. The handling of mail became increasingly automated.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Internet came to change the conditions for physical mail.

		<Chinese>[TAB]由中介人从一个人或一个地方携带到另一个人的书面文件进行交流的做法几乎可以肯定地追溯到写作发明的年代。但是，正式邮政系统的开发发生的时间要晚得多。在埃及，有组织的快递服务首次用于散布书面文件，这是法老王首次利用信使在该国领土上散布其法令。[PARAGRAPH：2]真正的邮政系统的发展来自古代波斯，但发明的重点仍然存在。记载最充分的索赔（Xenophon）将发明归功于波斯国王居鲁士大帝（550 BC），而其他作家则将其继承人波斯的大流士一世（Darius I）（521 BC）归功于此。其他消息来源声称亚述邮政系统的日期要早得多，这要归功于Hammurabi（公元前1700年）和Sargon II（公元前722年）。但是，邮件可能不是该邮政服务的主要任务。该系统作为情报收集设备的作用已得到充分证明，该服务（后来）被称为“安格里亚伊”（anariae），该术语随即转为表示税制。旧约圣经（Esther，VIII）提到了这个系统：Medes之王Ahasuerus使用快递员传达了他的决定。[PARAGRAPH：2]波斯语系统在信息载体（称为Chapar-Khaneh）的站点（称为Chapar-Khaneh）上工作称为Chapar）将骑到下一个职位，随后他将他的马换成新的，以最大程度地提高性能和交付速度。希罗多德斯用这种方式描述了这个系统：“据说，整个旅程有很多天，沿路站立的人和马太多了，每匹马和人在一天的旅程中间隔一遍；以及这些都没有被雪，雨，热或黑暗所阻止，无法全速地完成其指定的路线。[PARAGRAPH：2]莫里扬帝国（公元前322-185年）下的经济增长和政治稳定见证了令人印象深刻的民用基础设施的发展在古代印度。 Mauryans开发了早期的印度邮件服务以及公共井，休息室和其他公共设施。在古印度，有时将称为Dagana的普通战车用作邮递战车。[PARAGRAPH：2]在古代，国王，皇帝，统治者，zamindars或封建领主通过受过专门训练的警察或军事机构及信使的情报服务来保护自己的土地。通过跑步者，信使甚至鸽子传递和获取信息的服务。特勤局局长被称为邮政局长，维持着沟通渠道……人们过去常常通过朋友或邻居向远方亲戚发信。[PARAGRAPH：2]印度早期的邮票印有大象的水印。头。 [PARAGRAPH：2]在印度南部，迈索尔王国的Wodeyar王朝（1399年至1947年）使用邮件服务进行间谍活动，从而获得了与远距离事件相关的知识。[PARAGRAPH：2] 18世纪，印度的邮政系统达到了令人印象深刻的效率水平。根据英国国民托马斯·布劳顿（Thomas Broughton）的说法，焦特布尔的大公每天从他的首都向纳萨德瓦拉（320公里）献花，他们赶在日出时赶到了第一个宗教达尔山。后来，当英国王朝建立对印度的完全控制权时，该系统经历了完全现代化。 1837年的《第十七号邮局法》规定，印度总督会同行政会议享有在东印度公司领土内以邮递方式出租信件的专有权。这些邮件免费提供给某些官员，随着时间的流逝，这成为有争议的特权。在此基础上，印度邮政局于1837年10月1日成立。[PARAGRAPH：2]自汉朝（公元前206年至220年）以来，中国便享有邮政中继站。元朝时期，在忽必烈汗（Kublai Khan）的领导下，中国融入了蒙古帝国更大的&#214;rt&#246;&#246;系统。[PARAGRAPH：2]第一个有据可查的邮政服务是罗马。它是在奥古斯都·凯撒（Augustus Caesar）（公元前62年-公元14年）成立时组织的，它也许也是第一个真正的邮件服务。这项服务被称为“ cursus publicus”，并配备了名为“rhed&#195;”的轻便马车和快马。此外，还有另一项较慢的服务，配备了由牛拉动的两轮小车（birol&#195;&#166;）。该服务保留给政府来往。 [PARAGRAPH：2]成吉思汗在蒙古帝国内部安装了整个帝国的信使和邮政系统，名为&#214;rt&#246;&#246;。元朝在忽必烈汗统治下，这一制度也覆盖了中国的领土。邮政站不仅用于公务邮件的传输和传递，而且还用于旅行官员，军人和外国要人。这些车站帮助和便利了外国和国内贡品的运输以及一般贸易。到忽必烈汗统治结束时，仅在中国就有1400多个邮政站，而这些邮政站又为他们提供了约5万匹马，1400头牛，6700 les，400辆车，6000艘船，200多只狗和1150只绵羊。[PARAGRAPH ：2]这些站相距15至40英里，并且有可靠的服务员为邮件服务工作。马可·波罗（Marco Polo）等外国观察员已经证明了这种早期邮政系统的效率。[PARAGRAPH：2]哈里发穆阿维雅在伊斯兰世界创造了另一项重要的邮政服务； [PARAGRAPH：2]在中世纪之前，在中世纪之前，他们都利用归巢的鸽子作为鸽舍，因此这项服务被称为barid，是为了保护快递员所经过的道路而建造的。这只鸟的巢穴，由于其特别发达的定向感，在远离巢穴时能够找到回家的路。然后将信息绑在鸽子的腿上，鸽子的腿被释放并可以到达其最初的巢。[PARAGRAPH：2]邮件在整个历史中还通过其他多种方法运输，包括狗拉雪橇，气球，火箭，ule子，气动管[PARAGRAPH：2]许多宗教团体都有私人邮件服务，特别是西多会的一员将6000多个修道院，修道院和教堂连接起来。然而，最好的组织是由圣殿骑士团创建的。从博洛尼亚（1158）开始，新成立的大学也提供私人服务。[PARAGRAPH：2]通过文士服务来普及文盲。需要交流的文盲将其信息传达给抄写员，现在另一个职业普遍消失了。[PARAGRAPH：2] 1505年，神圣罗马帝国皇帝马克西米利安一世在帝国建立了一个邮政系统，任命弗朗茨·冯·图恩和出租车来运营它。 Thurn and Taxis家族（当时称为Tassis）从1290年开始在意大利各城市之间运营邮政服务。在1806年帝国废除之后，瑟恩和的士邮政系统继续作为一个私人组织，继续存在于邮票时代，直到1871年以后被新德意志帝国的邮政系统吸收。[PARAGRAPH：2]英国，在1840年之前，邮政系统昂贵，令人困惑，并被视为腐败。信件是由收件人而不是发件人支付的，并根据信件行进的距离和所含纸张的数量收费。如果有人可以说永远改变了邮政服务的面貌，那就是罗兰·希尔爵士，他根据便士邮费的概念对邮政系统进行了改革，并解决了预付款问题。在他的提案中，希尔还呼吁使用官方预打印的信封和不干胶邮票作为让发件人支付邮费的替代方式，而在这种情况下，预付是可选的，这导致了邮票Penny Black的发明。 [PARAGRAPH：2]大约是在这个时候，大多数邮政系统都被国有化和集中化。今天，对邮件系统的研究被称为邮政历史。[PARAGRAPH：2]邮政系统在现代交通发展中非常重要。铁路运输铁路邮局。在20世纪，航空邮件成为洲际邮件的首选运输方式。邮递员开始使用邮件卡车。邮件的处理变得越来越自动化。[PARAGRAPH：2]互联网开始改变物理邮件的条件。电子邮件（以及近年来的社交网站）成为了激烈的竞争者，但是在线拍卖和互联网购物为人们带来了新的商机，因为人们经常通过邮件在网上购买商品。</Chinese>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_CIV_VIKING_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]More properly known as Scandinavians or Norsemen, the Vikings were a group of people from northern Europe who became famous for carrying out a series of raids across the continent between roughly 800 - 1050 AD. The period is sometimes known as the "Viking Age," and it was an era of chaos and disruption for large parts of Europe. The Vikings can be classified into three main groups: the Danes largely attacked England; the Norwegians visited Scotland, Ireland, and points further west; while the Swedes invaded the river systems of what is now Russia. Although the Vikings usually employed hit and run tactics, many of them settled in new communities in the areas they had subjugated, eventually mixing with the local population. And while the Vikings are thought today to be bloodthirsty brigands, they probably acted more often as commercial traders than as warriors.[PARAGRAPH:2]Historians debate the reason why the Vikings suddenly emerged from Scandinavia at the end of the eighth century AD and began preying upon other parts of Europe. Theories include: the Vikings were suffering overpopulation caused by better agricultural tools; that the unification of Norway led to an excess of idle warriors; the Vikings were reacting to attempts by the Franks to muscle them out of trade with the east; or that the men went off to raid and pillage out of simple boredom. One particularly interesting theory is that the climate of Europe was warmer during the early Middle Ages, leading to an excess population in Scandinavia and the subsequent Viking colonization of places such as Iceland and Greenland.[PARAGRAPH:2]Whatever the actual reason for their expansion, the Viking drive outward began with the sacking of the important island monastery of Lindisfarne, located off the coast of Britain, in 793 AD. England was regularly raided by the Danes in the following decade, and in 865 a major invasion landed in East Anglia. This force was led by several landless Viking kings; in the battles that followed most of the English kingdoms were defeated, but the state of Wessex under Alfred the Great managed to hold the invaders off. The Vikings settled in Northumbria, and their territory became known as the "Danela" (most of these Vikings were Danes).[PARAGRAPH:2]Another wave of Vikings landed in England in 947 under the command of Erik Bloodaxe, who managed to capture the city of York. Vikings would largely remain in control of England until the Norman invasion of 1066 - and the Normans were themselves the French descendents of Vikings. Scotland and Ireland also experienced a heavy Norwegian Viking presence at this time; a number of important cities were founded by them - including Dublin. Eventually the Vikings settled down and intermarried with the native Irish.[PARAGRAPH:2]The main target for Viking aggression, however, was France. All throughout the ninth century the Vikings sailed up and down the Seine River with impunity, sacking French towns and monasteries at their leisure. Finally the French king Charles the Simple made an agreement with the Viking leader Hrolf Ganger in 911, in which Hrolf was granted control over territory in northern France. In exchange, Hrolf and his men agreed to convert to Christianity and become vassals of the French king. Hrolf's name was changed to Rollo and he became duke of the province of Normandy (named for the Norsemen who settled in it). The Normans retained their martial edge even after conversion to Christianity, and would go on to make a number of important conquests in England, the Mediterranean, and during the Crusades.[PARAGRAPH:2]The exploits of the Viking sailors were the stuff of legend. Viking mariners found their way to Iceland, Greenland, and even Newfoundland in North America, setting up colonies in all of these locations. Viking longboats were both fast and seaworthy, and their shallow drafts allowed them to sail far up the river systems of Europe. The Vikings could strike from the sea and be gone again before the military forces of a kingdom could be marshaled to meet them. In the east, the Swedes traveled down the rivers of modern Russia and founded the state of Kievan Rus', which grew rich off the river trade between the Baltic and the Byzantine Empire. These Vikings also found employment as mercenaries within the Byzantine domains, and their most elite warriors found employment in the Byzantine Varangian Guard. The Viking Age finally came to a close around 1050AD, as the Vikings were incorporated into Christian Europe and settled down to the less exciting but more stable pursuits of agriculture and fishing; their reputation as fierce invaders from the sea has endured to this day.</English>

		<Chinese>“维京人”的更准确名称应为“斯堪的纳维亚人”或“北欧人”，他们的巨大声名主要来自于800至1050年间在欧洲各地的劫掠生涯。这一时期也因而被称为“维京时代”，当时的欧洲大部分地区都因维京入侵而陷于混乱和恐慌。维京人可以细分为三大族群：丹麦人，他们入侵的对象主要是英格兰；挪威人，他们航行的方向包括苏格兰、爱尔兰，以及更遥远的西方；瑞典人则沿河流深入今属俄罗斯的广袤原野。维京人通常都是四处流动袭扰，但其中也有一部分在他们所征服的土地上定居下来，最终同原住民融合在一起。虽然当代的人们总是把维京人视为一群嗜血的暴徒，但是他们最常从事的职业其实是商人而非战士。[PARAGRAPH:2:1]对于8世纪末的维京人为何突然离开斯堪的纳维亚掀起入侵欧洲大陆的风潮，历史学家仍在争论不休。相关的理论包括：维京人农业技术的发展造成人口过度膨胀；挪威的统一导致大批战士无所事事；法兰克人大力挤占东欧贸易份额激起维京人的报复；或仅仅是由于维京人厌倦了沉闷无趣的定居生活想找点刺激……另一个有趣的理论认为中世纪早期欧洲气候变暖导致斯堪的纳维亚人口大量增加，也使得冰岛和格陵兰更适于移民居住。[PARAGRAPH:2:1]无论真正的原因为何，维京人扩张的时代开始了，他们最早发动的一次袭击是在793年洗劫不列颠东部海滨著名的林迪斯法尼岛修道院。此后十余年英格兰频繁遭丹麦人入侵，包括865年对东盎格利亚的大规模进攻。这批维京入侵者包括多名失去领地的维京王族，当时的英格兰诸王国大都被摧垮，只有西撒克斯王国在阿尔弗雷德大帝的领导下击退了入侵者。这批维京人随后在诺森伯兰定居下来，其领地被称为“丹尼拉”（因为他们主要来自丹麦）。[PARAGRAPH:2:1]947年，另一批维京人在埃里克·布拉德艾克斯的率领下登陆英格兰并攻占了约克。此后维京人继续统治英格兰大部分地区，直到1066年的诺曼征服——而实际上诺曼人就是定居法国的维京人后裔（详情见后文）。在这一时期，苏格兰与爱尔兰也处于来自挪威的维京人控制之下，当地的许多城市都是他们建立的——包括都柏林。维京移民与爱尔兰原住民相互通婚，逐渐融合到一起。[PARAGRAPH:2:1]不过维京入侵的最主要对象还是法国。在整个9世纪，维京人沿塞纳河横行无阻，随心所欲地劫掠法国城镇与修道院。911年，当时的法王“庸人”查理与维京人首领赫罗夫·冈格尔签订和约，赫罗夫获得了法国西北地区的统治权，作为交换，赫罗夫及其手下皈依了基督教并承认法王的宗主权，他们被称为“诺曼人”（即“北方人”之意），改名罗洛的赫罗夫也就成为诺曼底公爵。诺曼人在皈依基督教之后仍然保持着尚武的传统，他们对英格兰及地中海沿岸的征服在历史上造成了深远的影响，也是十字军东征的重要参与者。[PARAGRAPH:2:1]维京人的海上探险历险仿佛是一部传奇。维京航海家的足迹远至冰岛、格陵兰，甚至北美洲的纽芬兰，在这些地方建立了许多定居点。维京人的海船航速极快且易与操纵，由于吃水较浅也能够深入欧洲内河。因此维京人能够快速自海上发动袭击，并在敌人的大军赶到前扬长而去。瑞典人在东欧溯江而上，建立了后来的基辅罗斯公国，基辅罗斯凭借内河航运优势在波罗的海诸国与拜占庭帝国之间开展繁忙的贸易活动。许多维京人还成为了拜占庭帝国的雇佣军，即“瓦兰吉卫士”。随着维京人逐渐融入欧洲基督教世界，他们转而从事农业和渔业，开始平静的定居生活。到1050年左右，维京时代最终结束，但他们的海上劫掠生涯留给世人的印象实在太深刻了，直到今天，“维京人”依然是“海盗”的同意词。[PARAGRAPH:2:1]</Chinese>

It is governed as an autonomous polity within the Greek Republic. Mount Athos is home to 20 monasteries under the direct jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mount Athos is commonly referred to in Greek as the "Holy Mountain" and the entity as the "Athonite State". Other languages of Orthodox tradition also use names translating to "Holy Mountain". In the classical era, while the mountain was called Athos, the peninsula was known as Act&#233; or Akt&#233;.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mount Athos has been inhabited since ancient times and is known for its nearly 1,800-year continuous Christian presence and its long historical monastic traditions, which date back to at least 800 A.D. and the Byzantine era. Today, over 2,000 monks from Greece and many other countries, including Eastern Orthodox countries such as Romania, Moldova, Georgia, Bulgaria, Serbia and Russia, live an ascetic life in Athos, isolated from the rest of the world. The Athonite monasteries feature a rich collection of well-preserved artifacts, rare books, ancient documents, and artworks of immense historical value, and Mount Athos has been listed as a World Heritage site since 1988.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although Mount Athos is legally part of the European Union like the rest of Greece, the Monastic State of the Holy Mountain and the Athonite institutions have a special jurisdiction which was reaffirmed during the admission of Greece to the European Community (precursor to the EU).

		<English>[TAB]Artificial satellites are spacecraft that maintain an orbit around a celestial body. What differentiates an orbit from other types of space flight is it doesn't require any additional propulsion. Satellites can hold a number of different orbits. One type is a polar orbit, which causes the spacecraft to pass over the north and south poles. Another is an equatorial orbit, which causes the satellite to circle the Earth's equator. The farther the orbit from the surface of the earth, the longer it takes to complete a circuit of the earth. If the vessel uses an equatorial orbit at a distance of 22,300 miles from Earth, it can achieve geo-synchronous orbit, which causes the satellite to remain stationary over a specific area.</English>

		<English>[H1]Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Prime Minister of the United Kingdom[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1874 - 1965 AD[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Winston Churchill, whose full name was, "Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill," was undoubtedly one of the most important people of the twentieth century. At various times a soldier, journalist, author, and politician, during his long life Churchill was known for both his intellectual brilliance and his outspoken support for what were often unpopular opinions. At various times he was either the most beloved or the most hated man in Britain. In the years since his death Churchill's reputation has grown to semi-legendary proportions.[PARAGRAPH:2]A descendant of the famous English general the Duke of Marlborough, Churchill was born in 1874 at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire. After a mediocre performance at the public school Harrow, Churchill joined the army, where he freely used his family connections to get assigned to several colonial wars, narrowly escaping death on a number of occasions - and by all accounts having a ripping good time while doing so. During this period Churchill became a very popular wartime journalist, writing numerous columns and several best-selling books about his experiences. Churchill's maneuvering and flagrant self-promotion alienated his fellow officers and essentially ended any chance of high promotion in the Army; however he was able to parlay his popularity to gain a seat in Parliament.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1900 Churchill was elected to a Conservative seat in Parliament. However in 1904 his strong opposition to the Conservative policy of tariff protectionism led him to change parties and join the Liberals, who held power at the time. In the Liberal government Churchill held a number of different minor posts. In 1911 he was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty, overseeing the Royal Navy's ambitious modernization program.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the First World War, Churchill approved the disastrous Gallipoli invasion of Turkey. Churchill was soundly criticized for the failure, and in 1916 he resigned the Admiralty and left the government, rejoined the army and went off to the Western Front to fight in the trenches.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite his many eccentricities and flaws, however, Churchill was widely recognized as one of the ablest men in Great Britain, and in 1917 he was back in government again, holding a number of important Cabinet posts. After the Liberal Government fell in 1923 Churchill swapped parties once again and joined the Conservatives, famously saying, "Anyone can rat [change parties], but it takes a certain ingenuity to re-rat." He was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1924 and presided over Britain's disastrous return to the Gold Standard, for which he was again soundly criticized. After the Conservative Government fell in the 1929 General Election, Churchill lost his government post and became estranged from the political power brokers in both parties.[PARAGRAPH:2]The rise of Nazi Germany also led to a resurgence of Churchill's political career. Although he had earlier praised Fascist Italy as a bulwark against communism, in the late 1930s Churchill became one of the few voices speaking out against the growing power of Hitler. When the British government adopted the policy of appeasement, Churchill was almost alone in voicing opposition, a position which gained him a number of admirers, but which also earned him a lot of public and political criticism.[PARAGRAPH:2]When the Second World War broke out, the public lost a great deal confidence in the government of Neville Chamberlain (who had spearheaded the policy of appeasing Hitler). To shore up support for his government Chamberlain asked Churchill to resume his post as First Lord of the Admiralty. Showing genuine greatness of character Churchill accepted the position, working tirelessly to improve the Royal Navy and absolutely refusing to criticize his Prime Minister during wartime. However by early 1941 it was clear that Chamberlain no longer enjoyed the confidence of the people or of Parliament, and Churchill was appointed Prime Minister of Great Britain.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the west the war began catastrophically for the Allies. The Germans launched their attack against the British and French forces in 1940. Supported by air power and infantry, the German tanks had outflanked the Allied positions, forcing the French and British into precipitous retreat, advancing so rapidly that the defenders didn't have enough time to reform a new line. The Germans came within inches of destroying the British army, forcing it to abandon all of its equipment and stage a chaotic evacuation at Dunkirk, leaving thousands of British soldiers behind to be captured. France was forced to surrender, and German soldiers occupied Paris.[PARAGRAPH:2]As past events had foreshadowed, Churchill was at his very best during adversity. Britain stood alone against Hitler. Her army was badly crippled; only the Royal Navy and Air Force stood between the British and the Germans. Churchill worked tirelessly to shore up Britain's defenses and to find allies against Hitler, and his brilliant rhetoric rallied the battered spirits of the British people and earned him the admiration of people across the world. Throughout the dark days of the Battle of Britain and the Blitz that followed, Churchill seemed to hold the empire together by sheer indomitable force of will.[PARAGRAPH:2]Diplomatically, Churchill was an opportunist. Despite his hatred of Communism and his extreme personal dislike of Stalin (who had earlier allied with Germany to gobble up Poland), when the Germans attacked the Soviet Union Churchill sought an alliance with the USSR, famously saying, "If Hitler invaded hell I would make at least a favorable reference to the devil in the House of Commons." His most important diplomatic task, however, was to cultivate the good will - and eventually the military intervention - of the United States.[PARAGRAPH:2]It can be argued that Churchill's friendship with American President Franklin Delano Roosevelt saved Great Britain from destruction. Facing strong internal opposition to becoming involved in the war, at first the President had to move slowly, maintaining at least a nominal appearance of neutrality while gradually shifting American public opinion from Isolation to Intervention. However when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor at the end of 1941, Germany stupidly declared war against the United States, allowing Roosevelt to openly bring the growing might of the US military and industrial complex to Great Britain's (and the USSR's) aid.[PARAGRAPH:2]Within a very short period the US Army Air Force was attacking German targets in Europe, and soon thereafter large numbers of American troops were staged in Great Britain, ending forever any chance of a successful German invasion. As the war progressed the growing English and American forces launched a major invasion of Europe while their air forces pounded German factories and cities around the clock, crippling the Nazis enough to allow the Soviet Union to annihilate the German army in the Eastern Front.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the war ended in victory Churchill lost power almost immediately - perhaps because the people thought he was too old, or because they didn't believe he was the correct leader to rebuild the shattered empire. Though he remained in Parliament for a number of years (and briefly regained the post of Prime Minister during the Korean conflict), by and large Churchill's direct participation in world events was at an end.[PARAGRAPH:2]After being voted out of office Churchill wrote a history of the Second World War, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953. In 1965 Churchill suffered a stroke and passed away at the age of 90. Churchill's death was mourned across the globe, and his funeral was attended by an enormous number of foreign dignitaries. His reputation has only grown in the years since his death, and today Churchill is possibly the most popular and revered figure in all of English history.</English>

		<Chinese>[H1]温斯顿·丘吉尔[\H1]英国首相[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]生卒年份：[\BOLD]1874-1965[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]背景：[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]温斯顿·丘吉尔的全名是：温斯顿·伦纳德·斯宾塞-丘吉尔爵士，他可以无庸置疑地位列20世纪里最重要的人物之一。他在不同时期从事过不同的职业，包括士兵、记者、作家和政治家，在他的一生当中，丘吉尔最为人所了解的是他对常常不受欢迎的见解表现出的聪明才智和坦率的支持。很多时候他在英国不是最受人爱戴的人，就是最令人讨厌的人。在他去世之后，丘吉尔的名声越发具有传奇色彩。[PARAGRAPH:2]作为英国著名将军马尔巴罗公爵的子孙，丘吉尔1874年出生于牛津郡布莱尼姆帕里斯。在哈罗公立学校获得普普通通的成绩毕业后，丘吉尔参军了，在那里他自主地利用他家庭的关系被指派到几个殖民战事当中，有多次差点丧命，而且据说都是在非常惊险的情况下逃离死亡的。在这个时期的丘吉尔成为一个很受欢迎的战地记者，并写了许多专栏和几本关于他的经历的畅销书。丘吉尔的肆意妄为和公然的自我晋升疏远了同行军官而且在本质上终止了在军中高升的任何机会。然而他却能够连本带利地提高他的声望来获得议会的一个席位。[PARAGRAPH:2]1900年丘吉尔取得在议会中保守党的一席。然而在1904年对于关税保护的保守党政策的强烈反对使他改变了党派并加入了自由党，该党派在当时很有权力。在自由党政府里丘吉尔担任许多不同的小职位。在1911年他被委派为英国海军大臣，监督英国皇家海军野心勃勃的现代化规划。[PARAGRAPH:2]在第一次世界大战期间，丘吉尔批准了导致损失惨重的土耳其加里波里登陆计划。丘吉尔因为这场失败受到强烈批评，并在1916年辞去海军部职务并离开政府，重新加入陆军并前去西线战壕里战斗。[PARAGRAPH:2]尽管他有许多怪僻和缺点，然而，丘吉尔被公认为英国最有才干的人之一，而在1917年他再次回到政府，在内阁中担任重要职位。1923年自由党政府下台后，丘吉尔再次改变党派并再加入到保守党，说了句著名的话“任何人都能变节（改变党派），但再变节需要一定的灵活性。”1924年他被委任为英国财政大臣，负责灾难性恢复金本位制计划，这导致了灾难性的结果，因此他再次受到强烈批评。保守党政府在1929年的大选下台后，丘吉尔失去他的政府职位并同两党的政治掮客疏远了。[PARAGRAPH:2]纳粹德国的崛起也使得丘吉尔的政治生涯得到苏醒。虽然他早期赞扬过作为对抗共产主义的防波堤的法西斯主义意大利，但在19世纪30年代末却成为其中少数大声反对力量在增长中的希特勒的人。当英国政府采取绥靖政策，丘吉尔几乎孤独的处在反对声音中，在这个形势下很多人敬慕他，但也受到很多公众和政治上的批判。[PARAGRAPH:2]当二战爆发，公众对尼维尔·张伯伦（对希特勒实施绥靖政策）的政府失去信心时。为维持对他的政府的支持，张伯伦邀请丘吉尔再度出任英国海军大臣。表现出性格真实伟大的丘吉尔接受了职位，不知疲倦地工作来改进皇家海军并在战争期间完全拒绝评论他的首相。然而到了1941年初张伯伦显然不再受人们和议会的信任，而丘吉尔就被委任为英国的首相。[PARAGRAPH:2]在西线，盟军的开局变成了一场灾难。德军在1940年对英法军队发动大规模进攻。在空军和步兵的支援下，德国坦克两翼包抄盟军的阵地，迫使英法两军紧急撤退，推进是如此的迅速，以致防守一方没有足够的时间去形成新的战线。德军几乎完全摧毁了英军的斗志，迫使他们在敦克尔克放弃所有的装备并实施了一场混乱的撤退，留下数千名士兵成为战俘。法国被迫投降，德军占领了巴黎。[PARAGRAPH:2]正如过往的事件所预示，丘吉尔在逆境下才会处于最佳状态。英国独力对抗着希特勒。英国陆军元气大伤，只有皇家海军和空军屹立在英国和德国入侵者之间。丘吉尔竭尽全力支撑英国的防御体系，并寻求同盟对抗希特勒，而且他出色的言辞重振了英国人崩溃的精神，并为他赢得了全世界人民的钦佩。在紧随的整个英国战役和闪电战的艰苦岁月里，丘吉尔似乎全靠意志中不屈不挠的力量把帝国紧紧团结在一起。[PARAGRAPH:2]外交方面，丘吉尔是个机会主义者。尽管他憎恨共产主义并十分不喜欢斯大林（他在早期和德国结盟吞并波兰），但是当德国人进攻苏联时邱吉尔就和苏联结盟，并说了一句名言：“即使希特勒入侵地狱，我也会在下院发表支持撒旦的声明。”不过他最重要的外交成就却是使美国最终下定参与军事干涉的决心。[PARAGRAPH:2]有人坚持认为是丘吉尔与美国总统罗斯福的友谊挽救了英国。由于国内强烈反对卷入战争，起初美国总统只能慢慢地鼓动，至少在名义上表现中立，然而却逐渐地使美国民意由孤立变为干预。然而当日本在1941年末偷袭珍珠港，德国愚蠢地向美国宣战，终于使得罗斯福能够公开地给予英国（和苏联）以充足的援助。[PARAGRAPH:2]在很短的时间内美国空军开始攻击德国在欧洲的目标，不久后大量美军登陆英国，永远结束了德国入侵英国的任何成功机会。随着战事的发展，壮大中的英美军队发动对欧洲的大反攻，同时他们的空军日以继夜地重击德国的工厂和城市，充分削弱纳粹以使苏联有能力消灭东线的德军。[PARAGRAPH:2]二战胜利结束后，丘吉尔几乎迅速地失去权力——也许是因为人们认为他年纪太大了，或者因为他们不相信他是重建破碎的帝国的好领导。虽然他留在议会里很多年（并在朝鲜战争期间暂时地恢复首相的职位），但基本上丘吉尔对世界政治的直接参与就到此为止了。[PARAGRAPH:2]卸任之后的丘吉尔撰写了一部二战史，他因此在1953年获得诺贝尔文学奖。1965年丘吉尔因中风而逝世，享年90岁。丘吉尔的去世令全球哀悼，大批外国政要参加了他的葬礼。他去世之后声誉日隆，时至今日丘吉尔可能仍是英国历史上最受欢迎和最受尊敬的人物。[PARAGRAPH:2]</Chinese>

Shorter range ballistic missiles stay within the Earth's atmosphere, while longer-ranged intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), are launched on a sub-orbital flight trajectory and spend most of their flight out of the atmosphere.[PARAGRAPH:2]The earliest use of rockets as a weapon dates to the 13th Century. A pioneer ballistic missile was the A-4, commonly known as the V-2 rocket developed by Nazi Germany in the 1930s and 1940s under the direction of Wernher von Braun. The first successful launch of a V-2 was on October 3, 1942, and it began operation on September 6, 1944 against Paris, followed by an attack on London two days later. By the end of World War II in Europe in May 1945, over 3,000 V-2s had been launched.[PARAGRAPH:2]A total of 30 nations have deployed operational ballistic missiles. Development continues with around 100 ballistic missile flight tests in 2007 (not including those of the US), mostly by China, Iran, and the Russian Federation.

He sought to restore the Mongol Empire, yet his heaviest blow was against the Muslim Tartar Golden Horde. He was more at home in an urban environment than on the steppe. He styled himself a ghazi (An honorary title given to Muslim rulers who have shown remarkable success in extending the realms of Islam) yet some Muslim states, for example the Ottoman Empire, were severely affected by his wars. A great patron of the arts, his campaigns also caused vast destruction. Timur told the qadis of Aleppo, during the sack of that newly conquered city: 鈥淚 am not a man of blood, and God is my witness that in all my wars I have never been the aggressor, and that my enemies have always been the authors of their own calamity.鈥漑PARAGRAPH:2]Timur鈥檚 talents were unique. He planned all his campaigns years in advance, even planting barley for horse feed two-years ahead of his campaigns. He used propaganda, in what is now called information warfare, as part of his tactics. His campaigns were preceded by the deployment of spies whose tasks included collecting information and spreading horrifying reports about the cruelty, size and might of Timur鈥檚 armies. Such psychological warfare eventually weakened the morale of threatened populations and caused panic in the regions he intended to invade.[PARAGRAPH:2]Whilst Timur uncharacteristic (for the time) concerned for his troops inspired fierce loyalty, he did not pay them. Their only incentive were from looting captured territory: a bounty that included horses, woman, precious metals and stones; in other words, whatever they, or their newly captured slaves, could carry away from the conquered lands.[PARAGRAPH:2]Timur鈥檚 short-lived empire also melded the Turko-Persian tradition in Transoxiana, and in most of their territories that he incorporated into his fiefdom, Persian become the primary language of administration and literary culture (diwan), regardless of ethnicity. In addition, during his reign, some contributions to Turkic literature were penned, with Turkic cultural influence expanding and flourishing as result. A literary form of Chagatai Turkic came into use alongside Persian as both a cultural and official language.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Triremes were ancient war galleys with three rows of oars on each side. The trireme was an improvement upon an older type of ship called the "pentekonter," which was similar in design but possessed only one row of oars on each side. (The standard "galleys" found in Civilization IV are pentekonters.) The staggered seating of the rowers on the trireme allowed for more people to be packed into roughly the same amount of space, and (more importantly) the extra manpower allowed triremes to travel at faster speeds. Some ancient sources claim that the trireme existed as far back as the eighth century BC, but the first known account of their use was by Polycrates of Samos in 525 BC during an invasion of Egypt. By the middle of the fifth century BC, triremes were in common use throughout Greece.[PARAGRAPH:1]The average trireme was about 35 meters long, carrying 170 oarsmen, 20 crew members, and 10 marines under the command of a captain. According to ancient sources, triremes could reach a maximum speed of about 20 km/hour in battle, or sustain a slower speed of 13 km/hour for a long stretch of time. Triremes also possessed sails but they were not used during combat. A Trireme's main offensive weapon was its "beak," a stout piece of sharpened wood (often clad in metal) which protruded directly forward from its bow, at or below the waterline. In battle the primary tactic was to use the beaks to ram and sink enemy ships, which required building up as much speed as possible to punch through the opposing ship's hull. This was a difficult task and required a great deal of cooperation from the rowers, as even a single rower moving out of place could greatly slow the ship. For this reason the rowers on Greek triremes were not slaves but instead well-trained free men who received good pay for their services.[PARAGRAPH:1]During the Persian War, the Greeks used their triremes to defeat the Persians at the decisive Battle of Salamis. Triremes also formed the backbone of the Athenian navy during the Peloponnesian War. As the war progressed Sparta and her allies created their own powerful fleet of triremes; these would be put into good use in 404 BC during the Battle at Aegospotami, when Lysander destroyed Athen's navy, cutting off the city-state's trade and eventually starving her into submission.[PARAGRAPH:1]Triremes would eventually be supplanted by the larger and faster quinqueremes, but the design was revived years later by the Romans, who, facing no major naval enemies, preferred the smaller and cheaper triremes to the more expensive quinqueremes. </English>

		<English>[H1]Gustavus II Adolphus the Great[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]King of Sweden[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1594 - 1632[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Gustavus Adolphus's death at the battle of L&#252;tzen at the moment of victory was a fitting end for a man who devoted himself to war. As the ruler of a Protestant country he became involved in the Thirty Years War in Germany, but he also fought against Denmark and Russia for control of the Baltic. He served his military apprenticeship in Poland, where he learnt valuable lessons about strategy and tactics, which he was later to employ in his German campaigns. Also, although not so often highlighted, as the ruler of a country with a seaborne tradition, Gustavus took a great interest in developing Sweden's navy to defend her shores and extend his authority over the Baltic Sea and its littoral.[PARAGRAPH:2]Only 16 when he assumed the throne in 1611, Gustavus first had to defend his country against Danish invasion. He also became engaged in a war with Russia which lasted until 1617. In the 1620s he began a series of successful campaigns to win control of the southern Baltic shore. He captured Riga in 1621, after a siege of only eleven weeks. From 1626-9 he launched annual attacks upon Polish Prussia, winning his first victory in open field at Wallhof (1626). Despite a setback at Hammerstein the following year, when his German mercenaries surrendered (18 May), Gustavus again defeated the Poles at Dirschau (8 August) although he was severely wounded in the neck. Helped by imperial Habsburg forces, the Poles were able to achieve a six-year truce in 1629.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gustavus learnt valuable lessons in his earlier wars which were to stand him in good stead for his invasion of Germany in 1630-2. First, he learnt not to rely entirely on mercenaries. Although the Swedish population was small, a system of conscription (Utskrivning), a tithe of the male population over 15 years old, organized by his chancellor, Oxenstierna (from 1617), yielded a field army theoretically up to 30,000 strong. In addition, mercenary troops largely recruited from Protestant Germans (but including a scattering of Scots and other exotic types) still played an important role, especially the 'Colored Regiments' (Yellow, Blue, Red, and Green in order of seniority). The infantry were also reorganized tactically upon the model of Maurice of Nassau. Company sizes were halved from 250 to about 140, with a 2 : 1 proportion of muskets to pikes (administratively eight companies to a regiment). In the field, they were deployed as small brigades of three or four squadrons (400-600 men) which anticipated later battalions. They were formed-up with one squadron thrown forward in a T-shape, which made the best use of their firepower, and allowed them to outmanoeuvre the larger tercios of the Spanish manner still used by the Imperialists. Gustavus's experience against the Poles had taught him the value of a mobile cavalry at a time when caracole tactics had reduced most western European horse to the role of mounted pistoleers. He taught them to charge with the sword, restoring their battlefield shock function. Finally, through the inspired developments of his master gunner Tortensson, the artillery became lighter and more numerous. In addition, each regiment was given a pair of rapid-firing and mobile 4-pounders to boost its firepower.[PARAGRAPH:2]In July 1630, Gustavus led only 13,000 men into Germany to rescue the Protestant cause, captured Stettin, and spent the rest of the year consolidating his position in Pomerania. The following spring, reinforced to 30,000 men, he swept south in a devastating campaign which included the destruction of enemy cavalry forces by night attack at Burgstall (27 July). In September he outmanoeuvred the imperial general Tilly and forced a battle at Breitenfeld. By now commanding over 40, 000 men, including 10, 000 Saxon allies, he matched Tilly's forces and outnumbered the enemy artillery by two to one (54 to 26 guns). Although the Saxons on the left wing were scattered by the charge of the imperial cavalry, the flexibility of the Swedish formations and their determination won the day. Galled by artillery fire, the imperial cavalry under Pappenheim charged and was taken in the flank by Baner's quickly manoeuvred mixed squadrons of horse and musketeers. Responding rapidly to the situation Gustavus advanced his foot and seized the enemy guns. When these were turned on the close-packed imperial foot, a massacre ensued. Tilly lost a third of his army. The following spring, after a brilliant and unexpected crossing of the river Lech, Gustavus defeated him again and Tilly was killed.[PARAGRAPH:2]When Gustavus attempted to drive the imperial army, now commanded by the able Wallenstein, from a fortified camp at Nuremberg, he suffered a bloody repulse (3 September). Wallenstein then outmanoeuvred the Swedes and forced Gustavus into a desperate encounter at L&#252;tzen, in which the Swedish king was killed leading a cavalry charge. Even without his leadership his army won another victory in 1633, but was defeated at Nordlingen (6 September 1634).[PARAGRAPH:2]Gustavus's ambition and will to war had made Sweden, briefly, a major player on the European stage both on land and at sea, but at an unsustainable cost. The system of conscription, bringing over 10, 000 men to the colors every year, saw numbers of men aged 15-60 fall by almost half in an already underpopulated nation.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gustavus Adolphus was killed at the Battle of L&#252;tzen, when, at a crucial point in the battle, he became separated from his troops while leading a cavalry charge into a dense smog of mist and gunpowder smoke. After his death, his wife initially kept his body, and later his heart, in her castle for over a year. His remains (including his heart) now rest in Riddarholmskyrkan in Stockholm.</English>

During his reign, Tang China flourished economically and militarily. For more than a century after his death, Tang China enjoyed peace and prosperity. During Taizong's reign, Tang was the largest and the strongest nation in the world. It covered most of the territory of present-day China, Vietnam, Mongolia and much of Central Asia until eastern Kazakhstan. It laid the foundation for Xuanzong's reign, which is considered Tang China's greatest era.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 630, Emperor Taizong sent his general Li Jing against Eastern Tujue (proto Turks)- to which Tang had once submitted-defeating and capturing its Jiali Khan Ashina Duobi and destroying Eastern Tujue power. This made Tang the dominant power in East and Central Asia, and Emperor Taizong subsequently took the title of Tian Kehan ("Heavenly Khan").[PARAGRAPH:2]Unlike many of the nobility of the time, Emperor Taizong was a frank rationalist, openly scorning superstitions and claims of signs from the heavens. He also modified important rites in order to ease the burden of agricultural labour. The modern Chinese historian Bo Yang opined that Emperor Taizong achieved greatness by enduring criticism which others would find difficult to accept whilst trying hard not to abuse his absolute power (using Emperor Yang of Sui as a negative example), as well as through his employment of capable chancellors such as Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui and Wei Zheng.

This was created largely in response to the Confucian demands for honest government; among other innovations, the Tang civil servants were hired based upon the results of a written examination, rather than through the more common methods of bribery and patronage, and thus had fewer ties to the wealthy and powerful nobility.[PARAGRAPH:2]The English followed the Chinese civil service model when they created a bureaucracy to manage their growing colonies. Though successful, the practice did not spread to Europe until the mid-18th century.</English>

		<Chinese>[TAB]文官制度（或者叫做“公务员制度”）是官僚机构的制度基础――即政府机构的组织和运作规范。有效率的文官制度要求制定标准的办事流程、明确的责任划分、等级设置和评价提拔体系。实现成功的行政管理，非常重要的一点就是保留清晰完整的文件记录。早期的文明是用粘土、蜡或者石板作为书写载体的，而纸的发明无疑为官僚体系和文官制度的发展带来了极大的便利。[PARAGRAPH:2]已知最早的文官制度出现在中国的唐朝（7至10世纪）。这种新制度的建立在很大程度上是由于儒家学说非常强调政府的诚信廉洁。唐朝规定行政官员（“公务员”）的选拔方式是通过科举考试，而不再是通过贿赂和推荐，这样就减少了官员与有权势的贵族间的瓜葛。[PARAGRAPH:2]后来英国人在管理其遍布全球的殖民地时也效仿了中国的文官制度。尽管英国人的实践非常成功，但是直到18世纪中叶，文官制度才在欧洲各国得到普及。</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]The Lubyanka is the popular name for the headquarters of the KGB and affiliated prison on Lubyanka Square in Moscow. It is a large building with a facade of yellow brick, designed by Alexander V. Ivanov in 1897 and augmented by Aleksey Shchusev in 1940-1947.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Lubyanka was originally built in 1898 as the Neo-Baroque headquarters of the All-Russia Insurance Company, noted for its beautiful parquet floors and pale green walls. Belying its massiveness, the edifice avoids an impression of heroic scale: isolated Palladian and Baroque details, such as the minute pediments over the corner bays and the central loggia, are lost in an endlessly-repeating classicizing palace facade, where three bands of cornices emphasize the horizontal lines. A clock is centered in the uppermost band of the facade.[PARAGRAPH:1]Following the Bolshevik Revolution, the structure was seized by the government for the headquarters of the secret police, then called the Cheka. In Soviet Russian jokes it was referred to as the tallest building in Moscow, since Siberia could be seen from its basement. Another joke referred to the building as "Adult's World" as compared to "Children's World," the name of the popular toy store across the street.[PARAGRAPH:1]During the Great Purge, the offices became increasingly cramped due to staff numbers. In 1940, the most famous Soviet architect, Shchusev, was commissioned to double its size by adding another storey and engulfing backstreet buildings. Shchusev's design accentuated Neo-Renaissance detailing, but only the left part of the facade was reconstructed under his direction in the 1940s, due to the war and other hindrances. This asymmetric facade survived intact until 1983, when the symmetry was restored at the urging of Yuri Andropov in accordance with Shchusev's plans.[PARAGRAPH:1]Although the Soviet secret police changed its name many times, its headquarters remained in this building. Secret police chiefs from Lavrenty Beria to Yuri Andropov used the same office on the third floor, which looked down on the statue of Cheka founder Felix Dzerzhinsky. A prison at the ground floor of the building figures prominently in Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's classic study of the Soviet police state, The Gulag Archipelago. Famous inmates held, tortured and interrogated there include Sidney Reilly, Raoul Wallenberg, J&#225;nos Esterh&#225;zy and Father Walter Ciszek, S.J.[PARAGRAPH:1]After the dissolution of the KGB, the Lubyanka became the headquarters of the Border Guard Service of Russia, and houses the Lubyanka prison and one directorate of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB). In addition a museum of the KGB was opened to the public. On November 11, 1999 a fire broke out in the Lubyanka. Four FSB agents were injured, but damage was relatively mild. The fire was later traced to faulty wiring.</English>

It is said that Sukhothai was established as a sovereign, strong kingdom by Pho Khun Si Indrathit in 1238 AD. A political feature which "classic" Thai historians call "father governs children" existed at this time. Everybody could bring their problems to the king directly, as there was a bell in front of the palace for this purpose. The city briefly dominated the area under King Ramkhamhaeng, who established the Thai alphabet, but after his death in 1365, Sukothai fell into decline and became subject to another emerging Thai state: the Ayutthaya Kingdom in the lower Chao Phraya area.[PARAGRAPH:2]Another Thai state that coexisted with Sukhothai was the northern state of Lanna, centered in Chiang Mai. King Phya Mangrai was its founder. This city-state emerged in the same period as Sukhothai. Evidently Lanna became closely allied with Sukhothai. After the Ayutthaya kingdom had emerged and expanded its influence from the Chao Phraya valley, Sukhothai was finally subdued. Fierce battles between Lanna and Ayutthaya also constantly took place and Chiang Mai was eventually subjugated, becoming Ayutthaya's 'vassal'.[PARAGRAPH:2]Lanna's independent history ended in 1558, when it finally fell to the Burmese; thereafter it was dominated by Burma until the late 18th century. Local leaders then rose up against the Burmese with the help of the rising Thai kingdom of Thonburi of king Taksin. The 'Northern City-States' then became vassals of the lower Thai kingdoms of Thonburi and Bangkok. In the early 20th century they were annexed and became part of modern Siam, the country now called Thailand.</English>

The oldest parts of the canal date back to the 5th century BC, although the various sections were finally combined during the Sui Dynasty (581-618 AD).[PARAGRAPH:1]The total length of the Grand Canal is 1,776 km (1,103 miles). Its greatest height is reached in the mountains of Shandong, at a summit of 42 m (138 ft). Ships in Chinese canals did not have trouble reaching higher elevations after the pound lock was invented in the 10th century, during the Song Dynasty (960-1279), by the government official and engineer Qiao Weiyo. The canal's size and grandeur won it the admiration of many throughout history, including the Japanese monk Ennin (794-864), the Persian historian Rashid al-Din (1247-1318), the Korean official Choe Bu (1454-1504) and the Italian missionary Matteo Ricci (1552-1610).[PARAGRAPH:1]Historically, periodic flooding of the adjacent Yellow River threatened the safety and functioning of the canal. During wartime the high dikes of the Yellow River were sometimes deliberately broken in order to flood advancing enemy troops. This caused disaster and prolonged economic hardships.

After visiting the city, Mark Twain wrote that Varanasi "is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend and looks twice as old as all of them put together."[PARAGRAPH:1]According to Hindu tradition Varanasi is the home of Lord Shiva and his consort, Parvati. Known as the Destroyer, Lord Shiva is part of the "trimurti" - the three aspects of God - creation, preservation, and destruction. Shiva's consort Parvati is seen as Earth Mother, and, according to tradition, the two are the parents of all living creatures. The city is also held sacred because it is here that the Ganges River gained the power to wash away sins.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Kashi Vishwanath is a golden temple standing at the cities center. The date of construction of the original temple is not known. It was destroyed in 1669 by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, who built a mosque atop the ruins. The present Kashi Vishwanath was built in 1776, across the street from its original location. The newer building's spire is about 50 feet in height and covered with over one ton of gold plating, donated by Maharaja Ranjit Singh. The temple's interior consists of a mandapa (pillared hall) and a sanctum containing a silver altar.[PARAGRAPH:1]According to Hindu tradition, it was here that the first jyotirlinga, the fiery pillar of light by which Shiva manifested his supremacy over other Gods, broke through the earth's crust and flared towards the heavens. The altar contains a Shivalinga (an ancient symbol of Shiva) in its center to commemorate this event. It is believed that viewing the temple can transform a worshipper's life and put him on the path of knowledge and devotion, and each year the temple is visited by tens of thousands of Hindu faithful seeking enlightment.</English>

These representatives form a group (council, parliament, senate, etc.) that determines and implements government policy. After serving for a defined period of time representatives must stand for re-election. In some democracies there is a single head of state with limited authority: this may be a monarch or an elected ruler chosen by the people or by the representatives themselves.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]The greatest strength of democracy is that leaders are held accountable by people who voted for them and thus it is much more difficult to abuse power or introduce terrible policy. Decision making is much slower, but much more considered. The people have have a greater personal investment in the running of state and everyone has an equal say everyone in how things are decided. The negative side of this is that this includes everyone, regardless of intelligence or honesty. At its worst, democracy can potentially lead to 'tyranny of the majority' where minority groups are overlooked or persecuted if it is in the interests of the majority to do so. The right to vote can also be denied to certain groups, women and slaves for example.</English>

Born in Rio de Janeiro, he was the seventh child of Emperor Dom Pedro I of Brazil and Empress Dona Maria Leopoldina and thus a member of the Brazilian branch of the House of Braganza. His father's abrupt abdication and flight to Europe in 1831 left a five-year-old Pedro II as Emperor and led to a grim and lonely childhood and adolescence. Obliged to spend his time studying in preparation for rule, he knew only brief moments of happiness and encountered few friends of his age. His experiences with court intrigues and political disputes during this period greatly affected his later character. Pedro II grew into a man with a strong sense of duty and devotion toward his country and his people. On the other hand, he increasingly resented his role as monarch.[PARAGRAPH:2]Inheriting an Empire on the verge of disintegration, Pedro II turned Portuguese-speaking Brazil into an emerging power in the international arena. The nation grew to be distinguished from its Hispanic neighbors on account of its political stability, zealously guarded freedom of speech, respect for civil rights, vibrant economic growth and especially for its form of government: a functional, representative parliamentary monarchy. Brazil was also victorious in three international conflicts (the Platine War, the Uruguayan War and the Paraguayan War) under his rule, as well as prevailing in several other international disputes and domestic tensions. Pedro II steadfastly pushed through the abolition of slavery despite opposition from powerful political and economic interests. A savant in his own right, the Emperor established a reputation as a vigorous sponsor of learning, culture and the sciences. He won the respect and admiration of scholars such as Charles Darwin, Victor Hugo and Friedrich Nietzsche, and was a friend to Richard Wagner, Louis Pasteur and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, among others.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although there was no desire for a change in the form of government among most Brazilians, the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'&#233;tat that had almost no support outside a clique of military leaders who desired a form of republic headed by a dictator. Pedro II had become weary of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy's future prospects, despite its overwhelming popular support. He allowed no prevention of his ouster and did not support any attempt to restore the monarchy. He spent the last two years of his life in exile in Europe, living alone on very little money.[PARAGRAPH:2]The reign of Pedro II thus came to an unusual end-he was overthrown while highly regarded by the people and at the pinnacle of his popularity, and some of his accomplishments were soon brought to naught as Brazil slipped into a long period of weak governments, dictatorships, and constitutional and economic crises. The men who had exiled him soon began to see in him a model for the Brazilian republic. A few decades after his death, his reputation was restored and his remains were returned to Brazil as those of a national hero. This reputation has lasted to the present day. Historians have regarded the Emperor in an extremely positive light, and he is usually ranked as the greatest Brazilian.</English>

Once a civilisation grows to a certain size, power needs to be transferred to other people to maintain control, and a more sophisticated system becomes necessary to legitimise their rule.</English>

		<Chinese>在最早的社会里，统治者在行使他们的权力时没有把他们的个人权威放在眼里。早期统治者最重要的任务是战争和宗教领导，权威往往来自军事领导、成功征服或与神的联系。随着时间的推移，这些概念将进一步完善和扩展。例如，在希腊和罗马世界，修辞技巧被视为权威的重要来源。以一个人的技能和背景为基础的制度的最大优点是，对政府运作不忠诚和派系主义的风险较小。然而，一个人只能发挥他们的权力到目前为止。一旦一个文明发展到一定的规模，权力就需要转移给其他人来维持控制，一个更加复杂的制度就成为使他们的统治合法化的必要条件。</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]Archaeological evidence for the Old Babylonian school system suggests that scribal education was small-scale and usually took place in private homes. School tablets have been found in private residences in many sites across Mesopotamia. Some houses, where particularly large numbers of school tablets were unearthed, have been interpreted by archaeologists as "school houses" or homes in which scribal education almost certainly took place. The best example of this is House F in the city of Nippur. Nearly one and a half thousand fragments of tablets were found at this house. They date to the 17th century BCE (short chronology) (the early part of Samsu-iluna's reign), and the majority of them were students' school exercises. Two other possible "school houses" are located at the site of Ur. The first is a house called No. 7 Quiet Street, where a smaller number of school texts was found in situ and date to the late 18th or early 17th century BCE (short chronology) (reigns of Rim-Sin II or as late as Samsu-iluna year 11). The second is a house called No. 1 Broad Street, where a larger number of school tablets was discovered. Some texts from No. 1 Broad Street may date to as late as Samsu-iluna year 11 (1674 BCE short chronology, 1738 middle chronology). Unfortunately, it is unclear whether this house is the school texts' original place of use. Another Old Babylonian home in which scribal training took place is the house of a man named Ur-Utu, located in the ancient city of Sippar-Amnanum.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_UNIT_CELTIC_GALLIC_WARRIOR_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]The warriors of the Celtic tribes were widely feared by the inhabitants of the more civilized regions on the northern side of the Mediterranean. The Celts were known as tall, wild barbarians who fought with a savage fury. Conspicuous for their bravery, there are numerous accounts of Celts charging naked into battle with total disregard for their own safety. The Celts would often paint their bodies different colors to increase the intimidation factor. When clothed, the Celtic fighters wore brightly colored shirts and trousers, featuring striped or checkered patterns for decoration. They sometimes wore bronze helmets decorated with horns or wings in order to make themselves look even taller. The Celts were also head hunters, cutting off the heads of their defeated foes to serve as trophies. This was a way for a warrior to win great respect in Celtic society, and it may have served some religious purpose as well. The Romans were justifiably terrified of this practice and would often kill themselves rather than be taken captive by the Celts.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Celts are believed to have invented mail armor, which the Romans would adopt from them after the Gaulish sack of Rome in 390 BC. In battle, most Celtic warriors were probably equipped with spears, a simple weapon and easy to produce in large numbers. However, the Celts are much more famous for their use of large, two-handed iron swords. The Celts were the first to create these broadswords, which were used for slashing at the enemy (very different from the Roman short sword, which was entirely limited to stabbing). Celtic chieftains or other high-ranking figures were the ones most likely to carry these swords.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Celtic warriors were individually brave and fearsome fighters; however, they were also famously undisciplined. There was virtually no unit drill, and thus no unit cohesion: Celtic battles were wild melees in which every warrior fought as he thought best. Thus, while unmatched in personal combat, the Celtic warrior fared poorly against the group unity and strict discipline of the Roman legion.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Celtic tribes had almost no political unity either. Regarding each other with fear and suspicion and constantly engaged in petty internecine squabbles over territory, they were unable to pull together to face the approaching Roman threat. Facing this divided foe, General Julius Caesar was able to conquer Gaul in under a decade.</English>

The castle is regarded as the finest surviving example of prototypical Japanese castle architecture, comprising a network of 83 buildings with advanced defensive systems from the feudal period. The castle is frequently known as Hakurojou or Shirasagijou ("White Heron Castle") because of its brilliant white exterior and supposed resemblance to a bird taking flight.[PARAGRAPH:1]Himeji Castle dates to 1333, when Akamatsu Norimura built a fort on top of Himeyama hill. The fort was dismantled and rebuilt as Himeyama Castle in 1346, and then remodeled into Himeji Castle two centuries later. Himeji Castle was then significantly remodeled in 1581 by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who added a three-story castle keep. In 1600, Tokugawa Ieyasu awarded the castle to Ikeda Terumasa for his help in the Battle of Sekigahara, and Ikeda completely rebuilt the castle from 1601 to 1609, expanding it into a large castle complex. Several buildings were later added to the castle complex by Honda Tadamasa from 1617 to 1618. For over 400 years, Himeji Castle has remained intact, even throughout the extensive bombing of Himeji in World War II, and natural disasters such as the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake.[PARAGRAPH:1]Himeji Castle is the largest and most visited castle in Japan, and it was registered in 1993 as one of the first UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the country.

Along with Matsumoto Castle and Kumamoto Castle, Himeji Castle is considered one of Japan's three premier castles. In order to preserve the castle buildings, it is currently undergoing restoration work that is expected to continue for several years.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Palace of Versailles began life as a hunting lodge constructed at the instructions of King Louis XIII, who enjoyed hunting in the nearby woods. In 1660, his son Louis XIV decided to turn the "chateau" into a palace. Louis XIV took up residence in 1682, and construction on the palace was completed in 1688. During Louis' lifetime this huge, ungainly, and ornate building was not only his residence, but it also housed the royal court and central bureaucracy of France. Versailles is a complex of richly appointed buildings centered in one-and-a-half square miles of fine parkland. It is surrounded by beautiful fountains, statues, and magnificent formal gardens.[PARAGRAPH:1]At the very center of the palace was, of course, Louis' bedroom, a massive and ostentatious room. At the center of the bedroom was the Royal Bed, which was surrounded by a railing, suggesting that the king did indeed hold large audiences while reclining in the bed and needed a way to keep the visitors' fingers from messing up the royal linens.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Hall of Mirrors is another impressive room in Versailles. Over 200 feet in length and 30 feet wide, the hall contains 578 mirrors and 17 ornate windows. On the ceiling Louis had painted 30 pictures showing his many triumphs and the benefits of his rule.[PARAGRAPH:1]While appearing to many a massive exercise in royal excess, Louis had good reason for constructing Versailles; with one stroke he removed the nobility and bureaucracy from the intrigues of Paris and made them more immediately responsible to him. In this way he was able to render the once powerful nobility largely impotent; great families which had once battled each other for the throne of France now found themselves instead intriguing for the privilege of attending Louis' bath.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nonetheless, Versailles was, in fact, an extraordinarily expensive building. It has been estimated that maintaining the palace and its noble denizens consumed 6% of the entire French national budget. For a comparison, the United States' President's 2006 budget estimates that the US will take in about 2.2 trillion dollars in revenue in 2006. Six percent of that amount is 132 billion dollars.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the French Revolution and the dissolution of the monarchy, Versailles fell into disrepair and disuse. The German Army made the complex its headquarters after defeating France in the Franco-Prussian war in 1870. The building remained in decay until the 1960s, when Pierre Verlet conceived the bold idea of refurbishing Versailles to its glory days under Louis XIV. Since then the curators have managed to retrieve many of the original furnishings from across Europe.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The Indonesian archipelago was reached by the Modern Man in 45.000 BC. A migration from Southeast asia around 2000 BC brought many new techniques, and in the 8th century BC, the Indonesian people mastered bronze casting, wet-field rice cultivation, megalithik practises and much more. This allowed villages, towns and small kingdoms to flourish by the 1st century AD. With the introduction of Buddhism and Hinduism came great monuments, and both the Saleindra and Medang kingdoms built large Hindu and Buddhist stupas commonly called Candis, including the large Borobudut and Prambanan. In the 7th century however, this small kingdom society were soon to come to an end with the rise of Sri Vijaya.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sri Vijaya was a Malay kingdom formed on the island of Sumatra that flourished on its trade and naval power. While not a state in modern sense, it was rather a confederacy form of society centered on the royal heartland and trading center of Palembang. Especially the trade trought the Starit of Malacca gained the country financial advantages, and by the end of the 7th century Sri Vijaya controlled numerous trade cities along both sides of the strait. Controlling both the Malacca and Sunda straits, they lived on as a formidable economy and naval power well into the 13th century, and their reign saw the height of the Buddhist influence in Indonesia.[PARAGRAPH:2]The decline of Sri Vijaya in the 13th century left many of the Islands with regional kingdoms, and when the kingdom of Singhasari emerged on Java, Kublai Khan sent emmisaries to demand tribute. The Majapahit kingdom, an original ally of Singhasari and also based on Java, allied with the mongols and defeated the Singhasari, but then turned against them and forced the mongol forces to withdraw in confusion. This marked the beginning of the second large Indonesian empire, the Majapahit. Majapahit reached its peak under Hayam Wuruk and his prime minister and commander Gajah Mada, and just a few years after Gajah Madas death, Hayam Wuruk conquered Palembang and ended Sri Vijaya rule in Indonesia. Although the Majapahit rulers extended their power over other islands and destroyed neighbouring kingdoms, their focus seems to have been on controlling and gaining a larger share of the commercial trade that passed through the archipelago. About the time Majapahit was founded, Muslim traders and proselytisers  began entering the area.[PARAGRAPH:2]After Majahapits peak in the 14th century, Majapahit power began to decline and was unable to control the rising power of the Sultanate of Malacca. With an increased percantage of the population converting to Islam, the islands saw mostly muslim rule for the next centuries, with numerous different sultanates controlling the Islands.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the 16th century, sucsessful european invasions put the Sultanates to an end, with the Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and British seeking to dominate the Spice trade from India and the 'Spice Islands' of Indonesia. In the early 16 century, the Portuguese manged to control the trade, but in 1602 the Dutch parliament awarded the Dutch East-India Company with a monoploy on all trade and colonial activities in Indonesia at a time before the company controlled any territory in there. In the early 20th century, the monopoly was compleated and the boundaries of modern Indonesia was created. It was also in this period that the first Indoneasian national movement started, basing their idea of one Indonesian nation on Sri Vijaya and Majapahit.[PARAGRAPH:2]During World War II, Japan extended their Pacific empire to far away lands, including Indonesia. With the Dutch losing control of the archipelago, Indonesia decleared independance 2 days after Japans defeat and the and of the war. This marked the beginning if modern day Indonesia, and the first president, Sukarno, was elected. He introduced a form of democracy he called the 'Old Order', claiming that western democracy would not work in Indonesia. Although his methods worked in the beginning, he relied more and more on support from the Indonesian communist party, the PKI, which was the largest communist party outside of China and Soviet. With the party gaining more and more power, the militarya and the islamic groups, the other two major powers in Indonesia, got worried, and with the army did everything they could to weaken Sukarno. In March 1967, Sukarno were forced to abdicate and the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly named the army general Suharto as Acting President.[PARAGRAPH:2]Suharto brought many changes with him during his "New Order", which he named his goverment to differ it from Sukartos "Old Order", and early in his reign he invaded Papua after negotiations with the Dutch about the territory faied. The invasion was however easily repelled, and Suharto then gave them the "Act of Free Choice".

During his period he also transmigrated peole from the overpopluated areas to the more underpopulated islands, stating that this was for the good of the economy and industry and to give the poor a chance and he annexed the earlier Portuguese region East-Timor. During his reign Indonesia also became of OPEC, short for Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, due to large amounts of oil found in the area, something that helped Indonesias wealth, even when corruption was pretty usual during his reign.[PARAGRAPH:2]Within a few years, however, many of its original allies had become indifferent or averse to the New Order, which comprised a military faction supported by a narrow civilian group. Among much of the pro-democracy movement which forced Suharto to resign in the Indonesian 1998 Revolution and then gained power, the term "New Order" has come to be used pejoratively.[PARAGRAPH:2]Indonesia today is a country with much history. It granted independence to East-Timor in 2002, and its economy is growing. In 2004 a massive earthquake and tsunami devasted parts of Northern Sumatra, particulary the Aceh region. The same year Susilo Bambang won the first direct presidental election, and he was re-elected in 2009 to a second term. This shows that Indoneasia is on its way into a stable and democratic country, and the possiblity for them raising again as a power in Southeast Asia is still there.</English>

		<English>[TAB]The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the five big cats in the genus Panthera and a member of the family Felidae. With some males exceeding 250 kg (550 lb) in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park in India) while other types of lions have disappeared from North Africa and Southwest Asia in historic times. Until the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans. They were found in most of Africa, across Eurasia from western Europe to India, and in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is a vulnerable species, having seen a major population decline in its African range of 30-50% per two decades during the second half of the 20th century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are currently the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.[PARAGRAPH:1]Lions live for 10-14 years in the wild, while in captivity they can live longer than 20 years. In the wild, males seldom live longer than 10 years, as injuries sustained from continual fighting with rival males greatly reduce their longevity. They typically inhabit savanna and grassland, although they may take to bush and forest. Lions are unusually social compared to other cats. A pride of lions consists of related females and offspring and a small number of adult males. Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. Lions are apex and keystone predators, although they are also expert scavengers obtaining over 50 percent of their food by scavenging as opportunity allows. While lions do not typically hunt humans, some have been known to do so. Sleeping mainly during the day, lions are primarily nocturnal, although bordering on crepuscular in nature.[PARAGRAPH:1]Highly distinctive, the male lion is easily recognised by its mane, and its face is one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture. Depictions have existed from the Upper Paleolithic period, with carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves, through virtually all ancient and medieval cultures where they once occurred. It has been extensively depicted in sculptures, in paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire, and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoos over the world since the late eighteenth century. Zoos are cooperating worldwide in breeding programs for the endangered Asiatic subspecies.</English>

The sides of these streets are generally extremely attractive to business owners, advertisers, street vendors, and the like. However, while such operations are an economic necessity to the life of the city, allowing them to operate freely would tend to block the flow of traffic. One solution to this problem is the creation of 'squares,' large flat areas free of major construction. In such a square, merchants can set up shop freely on a temporary basis, vendors can wander, and the general population can mingle.[PARAGRAPH:2]As squares become more established and enshrined in a city's culture, it is common for some of them to be repurposed. Monumental architecture in the square is likely to get much attention, so it becomes a favorite place to construct statues and memorials. In some cities, a particular square may be placed in front of the royal palace, or in another key political location, from which political leadership can address the masses... or in which the masses themselves can directly discuss the issues. This serves to strengthen the ties between the general public and the ruling elite, and creates a stronger sense of collective 'ownership' of the state, even when the state itself is a totalitarian dictatorship.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Zoroastrianism or Mazdaism is known as one of the world's oldest monotheistic religions. It was once the official religion of Sassanid Persia and played an important role in Achaemenid times.  The prophet Zarathushtra, commonly known in the West as Zoroaster, lived in Persia no earlier than 1700 BC and no later than 600 BC, although Plato believed that Zoroaster lived some 6000 years previous to himself. Zoroastrianism is uniquely important in the history of religion because of its formative links to both Western Abrahamic and Eastern Dharmic religious traditions.  Zoroaster's writings suggest a metaphysical dualism, but devotional monotheism, requiring adherence to Ahura Mazda. Many modern scholars believe that Zoroastrianism had a large influence on Judaism, Mithraism, Manichaeism, and Christianity because of Persia's connections to the Roman Empire and because of its earlier control over Israel under rulers such as Cyrus II the Great, Darius the Great and Xerxes I.[PARAGRAPH:2]When the Sassanid dynasty came into power in Iran in 228 AD, they aggressively promoted their Zoroastrian religion. During periods when the Sassanids captured provinces held by the Romans, they often built fire temples there. During periods of Sassanid suzernity over Armenia, the Persians made attempts to promote the religion there as well.  By the 6th century, Zoroastrianism had spread to northern China via the Silk Road, gaining official status in a number of Chinese states. Zoroastrian temples still remained in Kaifeng and Zhenjiang as late as the 1130s, but by the 13th century the religion had faded from prominence in China.[PARAGRAPH:2]In the 7th century, the Sassanid dynasty was conquered by Muslim Arabs. Zoroastrianism, which was once dominant in a region stretching from Anatolia to Persian Gulf and Central Asia, did not have a powerful foreign champion as Christianity did in the Byzantine Empire, and so steadily lost influence and adherents in Iran under Muslim rule.  Iranian Zoroastrians fled to India in large numbers, where they were offered refuge on condition that they abstain from missionary activities and marry only in their community. Although these strictures are centuries old, Parsis of the 21st century still do not accept converts and are endogamous.   Zoroastrians in Iran are still persecuted by that nation's theocratic rulers, but even today one can find Zoroastrian communities living and practicing their faith there, such as in the province of Yazd, Kerman and Tehran.</English>

The men and women, a collection of soldiers and scientists, endured harsh conditions and physical and mental exhaustion, which were compounded by security so tight that many never saw the outside of the base on which they were stationed. They were sustained by their patriotism and by fear of what would happen to them, their families, and their countries if Germany created the bomb first.[PARAGRAPH:1]Eventually, of course, the effort paid off. By the middle of 1945 the US had two working atomic bombs. Germany, the original target, had already surrendered, but Japan was still in the fight. The two weapons were dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki early in August, and the Japanese Empire surrendered shortly thereafter.[PARAGRAPH:1]From our perspective some decades later, it isn't clear whether the Manhattan Project helped to save the world for democracy or brought it closer to fiery destruction. But the men and women involved believed they were fighting to stop a terrible dictatorship from gaining a new weapon and destroying everything they loved, and they were willing to sacrifice everything to succeed.</English>

After the European discovery of the continent by Dutch explorers in 1606, Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain in 1770 and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788. The population grew steadily in subsequent decades; the continent was explored and an additional five self-governing Crown Colonies were established.[NEWLINE][TAB]On 1 January 1901, the six colonies federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia. Since Federation, Australia has maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy. The federation comprises six states and several territories. The population of 23.1 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated in the eastern states.[NEWLINE][TAB]Australia is a developed country and one of the wealthiest in the world, with the world's 12th-largest economy. In 2012 Australia had the world's fifth-highest per capita income, Australia's military expenditure is the world's 13th-largest. With the second-highest human development index globally, Australia ranks highly in many international comparisons of national performance, such as quality of life, health, education, economic freedom, and the protection of civil liberties and political rights.

Since 2017, there are supercomputers which can perform over a hundred quadrillion FLOPS. Since November 2017, all of the world's fastest 500 supercomputers run Linux-based operating systems. Additional research is being conducted in China, the United States, the European Union, Taiwan and Japan to build even faster, more powerful and more technologically superior exascale supercomputers.[PARAGRAPH:2]Supercomputers play an important role in the field of computational science, and are used for a wide range of computationally intensive tasks in various fields, including quantum mechanics, weather forecasting, climate research, oil and gas exploration, molecular modeling (computing the structures and properties of chemical compounds, biological macromolecules, polymers, and crystals), and physical simulations (such as simulations of the early moments of the universe, airplane and spacecraft aerodynamics, the detonation of nuclear weapons, and nuclear fusion). Throughout their history, they have been essential in the field of cryptanalysis.[PARAGRAPH:2]Supercomputers were introduced in the 1960s, and for several decades the fastest were made by Seymour Cray at Control Data Corporation (CDC), Cray Research and subsequent companies bearing his name or monogram. The first such machines were highly tuned conventional designs that ran faster than their more general-purpose contemporaries. Through the 1960s, they began to add increasing amounts of parallelism with one to four processors being typical. From the 1970s, vector processors operating on large arrays of data came to dominate. A notable example is the highly successful Cray-1 of 1976. Vector computers remained the dominant design into the 1990s. From then until today, massively parallel supercomputers with tens of thousands of off-the-shelf processors became the norm.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_UNIT_OTTOMAN_JANISSARY_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]The Janissaries were an elite fighting force of infantry raised by the Ottoman sultans. They formed the sultan's household troops and bodyguard, eventually rising to a position of enormous influence before being disbanded in the nineteenth century. Murad I founded the Janissary corps around 1330; the troops were made up of non-Muslim boys who were captured in battle or bought as slaves and brought up as warriors. This was very similar to the Mameluk slave soldiers of Egypt, who may have been the inspiration for the Janissaries. Janissaries became the first infantry units in the Ottoman military forces, because at the time no free man would consent to fighting on foot.[PARAGRAPH:1]After 1380 the system for recruiting new soldiers into the Janissaries became standardized through a process called the "devshirmeh:" this was basically a "human tax" where each community had to contribute a certain number of young boys to the state. In practice these were almost always Christian slaves.[PARAGRAPH:1]The boys were sequestered in special barracks, where they would be converted to Islam and trained to become elite soldiers (a process very similar to that practiced by the Spartans of ancient Greece). Although slaves, the Janissaries received special privileges, including the right to bear weapons and higher pay than other soldiers. Although the Janissaries began their existence as a small bodyguard for the sultan, in time they came to comprise much of the Ottoman army, topping out at over 200,000 men at some points.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Janissaries originally were trained to be expert archers, but once firearms were invented they quickly adopted the new weapons, becoming fiercely proficient with muskets. They usually used axes or sabres for melee combat. Janissaries were present at all of the major battles in the early history of the Ottoman Empire, including the Siege of Constantinople in 1453.[PARAGRAPH:1]The very success of the Janissaries would eventually destroy them. Realizing their importance, they began demanding higher pay, threatening rebellion if their demands were refused. Their first rebellion took place in 1449, and it was followed by many more. By the eighteenth century, the Janissaries dominated the government. Through frequent palace coups they changed sultans as they wished, and they blocked much-needed modernization reforms in the Ottoman army. Many of the Janissaries became corrupted, no longer training for battle but instead pursuing commercial ventures or political office, and the weakness of the Ottomans in the face of Russian and Austrian expansion soon became obvious to all. Desperate to regain control of their country, the Ottoman rulers made determined efforts to eradicate them.[PARAGRAPH:1]Finally, in 1826 Mahmud II was able to form a non-Janissary army strong enough to challenge the Janissaries. The Janissaries did not go down peacefully, and Mahmud II had to use artillery to shell the Janissaries' barracks and batter them into submission. This event - known as the "Auspicious Incident," ended the Janissaries. Their characteristic marching music is the only trace of them that remains today.</English>

Naturally, sailors preferred to sail to destinations that had a method of marking these perils, so harbors with lighthouses flourished.[PARAGRAPH:1]The original "lighthouse" was probably a bonfire lit by villagers to guide the village's fishing vessels back to harbor at night. Over time people realized that the fires could be seen much farther away if they were built atop platforms or towers.

It is a subset of "intelligence gathering", which otherwise may be conducted from public sources and using perfectly legal and ethical means. It is crucial to distinguish espionage from "intelligence" gathering, as the latter does not necessarily involve espionage, but often collates open-source information.[PARAGRAPH:1]Espionage is often part of an institutional effort by a government or commercial concern. However, the term is generally associated with state spying on potential or actual enemies primarily for military purposes. Spying involving corporations is known as industrial espionage.[PARAGRAPH:1]One of the most effective ways to gather data and information about the enemy (or potential enemy) is by infiltrating the enemy's ranks. This is the job of the spy (espionage agent). Spies can bring back all sorts of information concerning the size and strength of an enemy army. They can also find dissidents within the enemy's forces and influence them to defect. In times of crisis, spies can also be used to steal technology and to sabotage the enemy in various ways. Counterintelligence operatives can feed false information to enemy spies, protecting important domestic secrets, and preventing attempts at subversion. Nearly every country has very strict laws concerning espionage, and the penalty for being caught is often severe.

		<English>[TAB]Constructed sometime around 1000 BC, the site of Petra in Jordan is among the most famous examples of rock-cut architecture in the world. Numerous intricately carved structures were cut into the sandstone walls of the desert canyons surrounding the area, as Petra came to serve as the capital city for the once-nomadic Nabataen people. The most famous of these structures, the Al Khazneh or "The Treasury," has been featured in numerous major motion pictures, notably a prominent role in "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" when the Al Khazneh was used to represent the location of the Holy Grail.</English>

		<English>[H1]Zhu Yuanzhang Hongwu[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Emperor of China[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1328 - 1398 AD[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Hongwu, known variably by his given name Zhu Yuanzhang and by his temple name Taizu of Ming (literally "Great Ancestor of Ming"), was the founder and first emperor of the Ming Dynasty of China. His era name, Hongwu, means "vastly martial".[PARAGRAPH:2]In the middle of the 14th century, with famine, plagues and peasant revolts sweeping across China, Zhu became a leader of an army that conquered China, ending the Yuan Dynasty and forcing the Mongols to retreat to the Mongolian steppes. With his seizure of the Yuan capital (present-day Beijing), he claimed the Mandate of Heaven and established the Ming Dynasty in 1368.[PARAGRAPH:2]Zhu was born in a poor peasant family in a village in Zhongli (present day Fengyang, Anhui). His father was Zhu Shizhen and his mother was Chen Erniang. He had seven older siblings, several of whom were "given away" by his parents, as they did not have enough food to support the family. When he was 16, the Yellow River broke its banks and flooded the lands where his family lived. Subsequently, a plague killed his family, except one brother.[PARAGRAPH:2]Destitute, Zhu accepted a suggestion to take up a pledge made by his late father, and became a novice monk at the Huangjue Temple, a local Buddhist monastery. He did not remain there for long as the monastery ran short of funds and he was forced to leave.[PARAGRAPH:2]For the next few years, Zhu led the life of a wandering beggar and personally experienced and saw the hardships of the common people. After about three years, he returned to the monastery and stayed there until he was around 24 years old. He learned to read and write during the time he spent with the Buddhist monks. Although he did not become a Buddhist in later years, he still remained sympathetic towards Buddhism.[PARAGRAPH:2]Historians consider Hongwu to be one of the most significant emperors of China. As historian Ebrey puts it "Seldom has the course of Chinese history been influenced by a single personality as much as it was by the founder of the Ming Dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang." His rise to power was fast despite him having from a poor and humble origin. In 11 years he went from being a penniless monk to the most powerful warlord in China. Five years later, he became emperor of China. Simon Leys described him as: 'an adventurer from peasant stock, poorly educated, a man of action, a bold and shrewd tactician, a visionary mind, in many respects a creative genius; naturally coarse, cynical, and ruthless, he eventually showed symptoms of paranoia, bordering on psychopathy.[PARAGRAPH:2]The folk song Fengyang Flower Drum was credited to him. His portraits were controversial.</English>

At the start of his reign he was considered a god and was absolute monarch of the entire known world; at the end of his reign he watched a small group of foreigners destroy his empire with ease.[PARAGRAPH:2]Montezuma ruled the Aztecs at the height of their power. His empire controlled a large portion of what is now modern Mexico. They had conquered virtually all other people around them, except for a few other nations, which they deliberately left free (so that they would have somebody left to make war against and to use as sacrifices).[PARAGRAPH:2]Though extremely rich and powerful, Montezuma's nation shamelessly squandered a great portion of its wealth and might. Much like the Egyptians, the Aztecs built huge monuments to their gods and held ever-increasing numbers of expensive religious festivals in which they slaughtered tens of thousands of prisoners and their own people. Montezuma himself lived in great splendor, his clothing made of silver, gold, and brightly-colored feathers. His court was brilliant, though much riddled with corruption and intrigue.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1519, Hernando Cortes led 600 Spanish adventurers with 20 horses and 10 cannon to the shores of Mexico on a mission of exploration. Hearing of the great wealth of the Aztecs, he took his tiny force west, determined to conquer this massive nation of five million. At the start of the march Cortes burned his ships to ensure that his men would not desert him.[PARAGRAPH:2]The natives that first faced Cortes were primitive and divided. They were terrified of the Spanish "demonic" horses and cannon and broke before their accurate musket-fire. Cleverly exploiting their political divisions, Cortes then enlisted the defeated peoples' aid by promising them revenge against the hated Aztecs.[PARAGRAPH:2]Montezuma watched Cortes' approach with fear and bewilderment. His religion told him that one day the god Quetzalcoatl would return in the guise of a light-skinned bearded man, and when that day occurred, the Aztecs were to welcome him with open arms. Surely Cortes was Quetzalcoatl, else how could he command an army of demons? On the other hand, Cortes was clearly bent on the conquest of the empire - should Montezuma not oppose him? Perhaps the sinful Aztecs needed to be punished![PARAGRAPH:2]Eventually, at the desperate urging of his advisors, Montezuma sent an army into the field against the invaders. But they were unable to offer effective resistance and Cortes' forces quickly overwhelmed them. The invaders then marched into the capital city Tenochtitlan virtually unopposed and took Montezuma prisoner. He was eventually killed during an uprising that pushed the invaders out of the city for more than a year.[PARAGRAPH:2]One has to wonder what would have happened if Montezuma had shown Cortes' courage and resolve and mobilized his people when the invaders first arrived. Could the Spanish have conquered Mexico against determined and organized resistance? Perhaps, but perhaps the natives would have held on long enough to learn to master the horse and gun - or at least their fear of them. If so, they would have become a formidable foe indeed.</English>

The Soviet Union launched it into an elliptical low Earth orbit on 4 October 1957, orbiting for three weeks before its batteries died, then silently for two more months before falling back into the atmosphere. It was a 58 cm (23 in) diameter polished metal sphere, with four external radio antennas to broadcast radio pulses. Its radio signal was easily detectable even by radio amateurs, and the 65&#176; inclination and duration of its orbit made its flight path cover virtually the entire inhabited Earth. This surprise success precipitated the American Sputnik crisis and triggered the Space Race, a part of the Cold War. The launch was the beginning of a new era of political, military, technological, and scientific developments.[PARAGRAPH:2]Tracking and studying Sputnik 1 from Earth provided scientists with valuable information. The density of the upper atmosphere could be deduced from its drag on the orbit, and the propagation of its radio signals gave data about the ionosphere.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sputnik 1 was launched during the International Geophysical Year from Site No.1/5, at the 5th Tyuratam range, in Kazakh SSR (now known as the Baikonur Cosmodrome).

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_CIV_INCA_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]Hundreds of years ago, a group of people calling themselves the Inca settled the Cuzco Valley high in the Andes Mountains of South America. Where they had come from was a mystery that still remains unsolved. Although their purpose for settling such a rugged and inhospitable landscape was unclear, the end result of their arrival is without doubt. In time, the Inca built an empire that spanned the Pacific coast as far south as Argentina and as far north as Ecuador, some 2000 miles of hills, mountains, valleys, and coastline. In just a short time (roughly 100 years), the Incan Empire dominated South America and is, to this day, considered one of the finest empires the world has ever known. Starting with the ninth ruler, Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui, the Inca began their expansion. Pachacuti won his first military campaign against the Chanca people, consolidated control over his cultural base of Cuzco, then turned his army south and conquered the Colla and Lupaca tribes. Though not the first Incan ruler, Pachacuti was by many accounts one of the finest Pre-Columbian persons that ever lived. It was under the rule of Huayna Capac, however, that the Incan Empire reached its greatest height. When his father died in 1483 and he became emperor in his own right, Capac continued the campaigns of the previous emperor, eventually extending the empire's borders into what is modern Colombia. A dedicated ruler, Huayna did much to improve the lives of his people. In addition to building temples and other works, Huayna greatly expanded the road network, along which he built storehouses for food so that aid could be quickly rushed to any who were in danger of starvation.[PARAGRAPH:2]Like many other groups that preceded the Inca (the Chimu, the Nazca, the Moche), Incan society was heavily dipped in the worship of powerful gods. Their pantheon contained such lofty omnipotents as Viracocha (the god of creation), Inti (the sun and father of the Inca Dynasty), Illapa (god of rain, thunder, and lightening), Pacha Mama (mother of the earth), and Mama Cocha (mother of the lakes). Grand ceremonies were held frequently to honor these gods, for the Inca believed that if one did not give thanks and obedience to the gods, bad things would happen. The world of the Andes Mountains is full of ecological wonders - and ecological disasters such as earthquakes, severe storms, and volcanic activity. The gods held sway with these events and thus the proper respect had to be paid at all times.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Inca called their empire Tahuantinsuyu (Land of the Four Quarters?), which was divided into four provinces. Each province was controlled by a local governor called the apu; below him were the local rulers - the curacas - and even lower still the district headsmen - the camayoc. Through this governmental structure, the Sapa-Inca could rule the empire with impunity. Additional structures were also put in place, such as the Imperial road system, which was built along the steep inclines of mountains, interspersing bridges and stone walkways, stone steps, and flat brick highways. In addition, way-stations known as tambos were constructed at strategic points along the roads, giving travelers and important dignitaries a place to rest and prepare for the next leg of their journey.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Incan army was also well organized. When called upon to fight, each province would muster squadrons of men armed with maces, bows and arrows, slings, darts, and spears. These fierce Incan warriors, known as the Quechua, conquered much of the Andes and coastal regions of what is now Peru and Ecuador in the period between 1440 and 1530 . During a battle, slingers would let fly a shower of rocks to soften the enemy lines. Then, archers would release their shafts, darts would fly, and then the shock troops would hit, in a torrent of screams and shouts meant to confuse and terrify the wavering opposition. Incan warfare was very successful. But nothing could prepare the empire for what was coming.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the glorious reign of Huayna Capac, the empire began to erode under a series of internal and external disasters. A bitter civil war between half brothers Huascar and Atahuallpa, the sons of Capac, stretched the empire to the breaking point. Atahuallpa won the war, quickly killed his half-brother, and declared himself king. But, in 1532 AD, Spanish Conquistadors, under the command of Francisco Pizarro, entered the Cajamarca Valley and brutally attacked Atahuallpa and his subjects, killing many and taking the Sapa-Inca hostage. Eventually, Pizarro killed Atahuallpa, pillaged the empire of its riches, and brought an end to the mighty Incan civilization. </English>

		<Chinese>数百年前，一群自称“印加”的人移居到南美安第斯山的库斯科山谷。他们从何处而来不为人所知。尽管至今尚不清楚他们为何选择在如此崎岖且不宜居住的地方定居，但对于他们曾经来过这一事实却毋庸置疑。很快，这些印加人就沿太平洋海岸线建立了一个延绵2000多英里（南起阿根廷北至厄瓜多尔），遍布丘陵、高山，峡谷和海岸的帝国。在短短的时间里（大约100年），印加帝国已控制了南美洲的大片地区，并且被认为是有史以来最成功的帝国之一。从第九位统治者，帕查库提·印加·尤潘基开始，印加帝国开始了扩张的历程。帕查库提首先赢得了对查恩卡人的战争，并通过建设作为文化中心的都城库斯科加强了统治力量，随后挥师南下，征服了科拉和卢帕卡部族。尽管帕查库提不是印加的第一任统治者，但他却被很多人认为是哥伦布发现美洲大陆以前最完美的美洲人。不过印加帝国达到强盛的巅峰则是在怀那·卡帕统治时期。怀那于1483年继位为印加皇帝，他继承前代皇帝的对外征战事业，最终使帝国的领土范围扩张到今哥伦比亚。怀那还是一位勤勉的统治者，非常注重改善臣民的生活。除了修建神庙和宫室，怀那还大规模地扩建道路网，并沿建造了许多石屋以存放为附近饥民提供的食物。[PARAGRAPH:2]与许多早于印加的部族一样（奇穆人、纳兹卡人、莫切人），印加社会中充满了对强大的众神的崇拜。他们自己的万神殿中同样供奉着无所不能的维拉科查（创造之神）、印帝（太阳神和印加之父）、伊拉帕（雷雨闪电之神）、帕查玛玛（大地之母）以及玛玛哥哈（湖泊之母）。盛大的祭祀活动定期举行，以表示对诸神的敬畏，因为印加人相信一个人一旦不感谢神的赐予，违背神的旨意，必将受到天谴。这个安第斯山中的世界中充满了自然界的奇观和灾难：地震、猛烈的飓风和火山活动。人们相信众神掌控着这一切，所以必须随时表达出对于神灵的充分的敬畏。[PARAGRAPH:2]印加人把他们的帝国称作塔华廷苏育，即盖丘亚语“四方”之意。帝国分为四个行省，每个省的最高长官称为“阿普”（总督），在他们之下的是地区长官“库拉卡斯”，其下还有更低一级的头领，被称作“卡玛约克”。通过这样的行政机构，“萨帕印加”（印加皇帝）能够毫无困难地管理整个帝国。除此以外还设立有其它机构，比如皇家道路系统，这些道路有的依山而建，有的密布桥梁，包括石质人行道和平坦的砖砌路面。在道路沿线的各战略要地还建有“坦波”（驿站）,作为旅行者及出巡显贵的休息和中转场所。[PARAGRAPH:2]印加军队具有有十分严密的组织。一旦收到战争动员令，各省就会迅速集结大批配备钉锤、弓箭、投石器、标枪和长矛的部队。这些凶悍的印加山地勇士被称为“盖丘亚”，以这支部队为主力，印加人在1440至1530年间征服了安第斯山脉以及东太平洋沿岸今秘鲁与厄瓜多尔地区。在战斗中，印加的投石兵能投射雨点般的石子以削弱敌人的阵线，接着是发射弓箭和标枪，其后是突袭部队出击。在狂风暴雨般的喊杀声中，敌人往往迅速陷入混乱，并最后崩溃。印加人在战争中总是无往不利。但这一切都无法挽救这个帝国即将面临的危难。[PARAGRAPH:2]在经历怀那·卡帕的繁荣兴盛时代之后，帝国受多种内外因素的影响而逐渐走向衰落。怀那·卡帕的两个儿子，异母兄弟华斯卡和阿塔瓦尔帕之间的内战将帝国带到了崩溃的边缘。最终阿塔瓦尔帕赢得了战争，并在杀死自己的兄弟之后登上王位。然而到了1532年，弗朗西斯科·皮萨罗率领西班牙征服者进入了卡加马卡河谷，兽性地攻击阿塔瓦尔帕和他的子民。无数的印加人被屠杀，皇帝也被囚为人质。最终皮萨罗处死了阿塔瓦尔帕，并将帝国的财富洗劫一空，曾经强大的印加文明就此毁灭。</Chinese>

An inexpensive fleet of torpedo boats could pose a threat to much larger and more expensive fleets of capital ships, albeit only in the coastal areas to which their small size and limited fuel load restricted them.[PARAGRAPH:2]The introduction of fast torpedo boats in the late 19th century was a serious concern to the era's naval strategists. In response, navies operating large ships introduced smaller ships to counter torpedo boats, mounting light quick-firing guns. These ships, which came to be called "torpedo boat destroyers" and later simply "destroyers," became larger and took on more roles, making torpedo attacks as well as defending against them, and eventually defending against submarines and aircraft. The destroyer eventually became the predominant type of surface warship in the guided missile age.</English>

In addition to grasses, shrubs, trees, and bodies of water, parks may contain playing fields for athletics, monuments, fountains, playground structures for small children, and trails for walking or cycling.

Ruling Persia during the first century, Darius both consolidated control of his kingdom and substantially expanded its borders, creating one of the largest empires in history.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the early years of his reign, Darius focused on quelling the various rebellions that had sprung up in the wake of his predecessor's fall. After retaking Persia, Media, Babylonia and sections of Western Asia back from the rebels, Darius focused on creating an efficient and effective bureaucracy within his empire.[PARAGRAPH:2]Darius devised a system in which each region would be the responsibility of a Satrap who would rule the region in his name. To prevent any individual Satrap from gaining too much power and challenging Darius' rule, the king implemented a series of checks and balances that effectively kept power from accumulating with any one man (besides Darius himself). Each region not only had a Satrap who was in charge of civil affairs, but a general who controlled the military, and the subtle presence of Darius' own secret police, who watched over them all. This system of government was so successful, it later became the inspiration for the governments of Alexander the Great and the Parthians.[PARAGRAPH:2]Darius I conducted two historically important military campaigns against the Greek mainland. During the first, around 500 BC, he invaded Greece in retaliation for their support of the rebelling Ionian cities within Persian territory. Unfortunately, his ships were caught in a storm off the Athenian coast and were wrecked. In the second campaign Darius I managed to successfully land on the Athenian coast, but was defeated in the now famous battle of Marathon in 490 BC.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite his failures on the Greek mainland, Darius I conquered much land in Europe, North Africa and India. His military campaigning and sophisticated organizational designs ensured Darius' place as one of the greatest leaders of the ancient world.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_SAINT_THOMAS_CHURCH_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]There has been a church at the current site of the Thomaskirche at least since the 12th century. Foundations of a Romanesque building have been discovered in the choir and crossing of the current church. Between 1212 and 1222 the earlier structure became the church of the new St. Thomas Monastery (Stift) of the Augustinian order founded by Markgraf Dietrich von Meissen. This monastery later became the core of the University of Leipzig (founded in 1409). In 1217, The Minnesinger, or troubadour, Heinrich von Morungen bequeathed to the church a relic of St. Thomas as he entered the order of canons after a trip to India. In 1355, the Romanesque choir was changed to Gothic style. Following an inflow of wealth into Leipzig from the discovery of silver in the Erzgebirge, the Romanesque nave was demolished and replaced in 1482-96 by the current late-Gothic hall church. The current building was consecrated by Thilo of Trotha, the Bishop of Merseburg, on 10 April 1496. The reformer Martin Luther preached here on Pentecost Sunday in 1539. The monastic buildings were demolished in 1541 following the monastery's dissolution. The current church tower was first built in 1537 and rebuilt in 1702. Chapels added in the 17th century and an ante-building along the northern front of the nave with two stairways were removed at the end of the 19th century.[PARAGRAPH:2]The composer Johann Sebastian Bach was choir director at St. Thomas Church from 1723 until his death in 1750 and taught at its affiliated school. A statue of Johann Sebastian Bach by the Leipzig sculptor Carl Seffner that stands next to the church was dedicated in 1908. On 12 May 1789, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart played the organ here. In 1806, the church served as a munitions depot for the French army. During the Battle of Leipzig, the Thomaskirche was used as a military hospital. Richard Wagner was baptized here on 16 August 1813. In 1828, he studied piano and counterpoint with the then Thomaskantor, Christian Th. Weinlig. Most of the Baroque internal trappings of the church known to Bach were removed in a Gothic revival renovation of 1884-9. Also from this period date the pulpit and the main portal in the west facade.[PARAGRAPH:2]On 4 December 1943, the tower was damaged in an Allied bombing raid on Leipzig, requiring repair. The authorities demolished the Johanneskirche, also damaged by bombs in 1943, in 1949 and the remains of Johann Sebastian Bach were moved from there to the Thomaskirche in 1950. In the 20th century, sulfur emitted from nearby coal mines, and other pollutants in the atmospheric air caused the deterioration of exterior stonework and statuary, and even of interior Gothic paintings. In addition, the roof structure suffered from damage due to insects and moisture. For these reasons, the church was listed in the 2000 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund. Repairs were swiftly undertaken with financial support from the Fund and from American Express. Repairs on the church in 1961 to 1964 also attempted to emphasize the Gothic hall church character of the building. Another renovation followed in 1991. From 1993 to 2014, a 15th-century Gothic altar (originally in the Paulinerkirche, the church of the University of Leipzig, destroyed in 1968 by the Communist authorities) was located in the Thomaskirche. It was moved to the new St. Pauli church (2014) and replaced in 2016 with a Gothic-revival altar by Constantin Lipsius made in 1888, which had been removed in 1964.[PARAGRAPH:2]A statue of Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, who lived in Leipzig from 1835 until his death in 1847, was dedicated on 18 October 2008, when it was re-erected opposite the St. Thomas Church on the occasion of the year of his 200th birthday. The 6-meter (20 ft) statue depicts the former Gewandhaus Orchestra director and composer in bronze. Celebratory speeches were given by Kurt Masur, also a former Gewandhaus Orchestra director, and Burkhard Jung, mayor of Leipzig. The original statue designed by Werner Stein was first dedicated on 26 May 1892. It had been located on the east side of the Gewandhaus until 9 November 1936, when it was taken down by the Nazis because of the composer&#8217;s Jewish background.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_MANUFACTORY_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]Although large mills and workshops were established in ancient China, Rome and the Middle East, the Venice Arsenal provides one of the first examples of a factory in the modern sense of the word. Founded in 1104 in Venice, Republic of Venice, several hundred years before the Industrial Revolution, it mass-produced ships on assembly lines using manufactured parts. The Venice Arsenal apparently produced nearly one ship every day and, at its height, employed 16,000 people.[PARAGRAPH:2]Many historians regard Matthew Boulton 's Soho Manufactory (established in 1761 in Birmingham) as the first modern factory. (Other claims might be made for John Lombe 's silk mill in Derby (1721), or Richard Arkwright 's Cromford Mill (1771) purpose built to fit the equipment it held and taking the material through the various manufacturing processes.) One historian, Jack Weatherford, contends that the first factory was in Potosa, for processing silver ingot slugs into coins, because there was so much silver being mined close by. See City and Factory Life for more background concerning factory conditions.[PARAGRAPH:2]British colonies in the late 18th century built factories simply as buildings where a large number of laborers gathered to perform hand labor, usually in textile production. This proved more efficient for administration and for the distribution of raw materials to individual laborers than earlier methods of manufacturing such as cottage industries or the putting-out system.[PARAGRAPH:2]Cotton mills used inventions such as the steam engine and the power loom to pioneer the industrial factory of the 19th century, where precision machine tools and replaceable parts allowed greater efficiency and less waste.[PARAGRAPH:2]Between 1820 and 1850, the non-mechanized factories supplanted the traditional artisan shops as the predominant form of manufacturing institution. Even though the theory on why and how the non-mechanized factories gradually replaced the small artisan shops is still ambiguous, what is apparent is that the larger-scale factories enjoyed technological gains and advance in efficiency over the small artisan shops.

		<English>[TAB]In steady decline since the 2nd century AD, the Roman empire broke into two parts in 285 AD: the Western Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire in the East. The western part under the pressure of Goths finally dissolved, leaving the Italian peninsula divided into small independent kingdoms and feuding city states for the next 14 centuries, and leaving the eastern part sole heir to the Roman legacy. The italian civilization was born from the ashes of the roman civilization.[PARAGRAPH:2]Following a short recapture of the Italian peninsula by Byzantine Emperor Justinian in the 6th century AD from the Ostrogoths, a new wave of Germanic tribes, the Lombards, soon arrived in Italy from the north. For several centuries the armies of the Byzantines were strong enough to prevent Arabs, the Holy Roman Empire, or the Papacy from establishing a unified Italian Kingdom, but were at the same time too weak to fully unify the former Roman lands themselves. Nevertheless, during early Middle Ages Imperial dynasties such as the Carolingians, the Ottonians and the Hohenstaufens managed to impose their overlordship in Italy.[PARAGRAPH:2]Italy's regions were eventually subsumed by their neighbouring empires with their conflicting interests and would remain divided up to the 19th century. It was during this vacuum of authority that the region saw the rise of the Signoria and the Comune. In the anarchic conditions that often prevailed in medieval Italian city-states, people looked to strong men to restore order and disarm the feuding elites. In times of anarchy or crisis, cities sometimes offered the Signoria to individuals perceived as strong enough to save the state, most notably the Della Scala family in Verona, the Visconti in Milan and the Medici in Florence.[PARAGRAPH:2]Italy during this period became notable for its merchant Republics. These city-states, oligarchical in reality, had a dominant merchant class which under relative freedom nurtured academic and artistic advancement. The four classic Maritime Republics in Italy were Venice, Genoa, Pisa and Amalfi.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the late Middle Ages, the present-day region of Italy was a collection of smaller independent city states and kingdoms and their dependencies.[PARAGRAPH:2]Venice and Genoa were Europe's gateways to trade with the East, with the former producer of the renowned venetian glass. Florence was the capital of silk, wool, banks and jewelry. The Maritime Republics were heavily involved in the Crusades, taking advantage of the new political and trading opportunities, most evidently in the conquest of Zara and Constantinople funded by Venice.[PARAGRAPH:2]During the late Middle Ages Italy was divided into smaller city-states and territories: the kingdom of Naples controlled the south, the Republic of Florence and the Papal States the center, the Genoese and the Milanese the north and west, and the Venetians the east. Fifteenth-century Italy was one of the most urbanised areas in Europe and the birthplace of Renaissance. Florence in particular, with the writings of Dante Alighieri (1265&#150;1321), Francesco Petrarch (1304&#150;1374) and Giovanni Boccaccio (c. 1313&#150;1375), as well as the painting of Giotto di Bondone (1267&#150;1337), is considered the center of this cultural movement. Scholars like Niccol&#242; de' Niccoli and Poggio Bracciolini scoured the libraries in search of works of classical authors, such as Plato, Aristotle, Euclid, Ptolemy, Cicero and Vitruvius.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Black Death pandemic in 1348 left its mark on Italy by killing one third of the population. The recovery from the disaster led to a resurgence of cities, trade and economy which greatly stimulated the successive phases of Humanism and the Renaissance. In 1494 the French king Charles VIII opened the first of a series of invasions, lasting up to sixteenth century, in a competition between France and Spain for the possession of the country. Ultimately Spain prevailed through the Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis which recognised Spanish dominance over the Duchy of Milan and the Kingdom of Naples. The holy alliance between Habsburg Spain and the Holy See resulted in the systematic persecution of any Protestant movement. Austria succeeded Spain as hegemon in Italy under the Peace of Utrecht. Through Austrian domination, the northern part of Italy gained economic dynamism and intellectual fervor. The French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars (1796&#150;1815) introduced the ideas of equality, democracy, law and nation. Italy's population between 1700 and 1800 rose by about one-third, to 18 million.[PARAGRAPH:2]The creation of the Kingdom of Italy was the result of efforts by Italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the House of Savoy to establish a united kingdom encompassing the entire Italian Peninsula. In the context of the 1848 liberal revolutions that swept through Europe, an unsuccessful war was declared on Austria. Giuseppe Garibaldi, popular amongst southern Italians, led the Italian republican drive for unification in southern Italy, while the northern Italian monarchy of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia whose government was led by Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour, had the ambition of establishing a united Italian state under its rule. The kingdom successfully challenged the Austrian Empire in the Second Italian War of Independence with the help of Napoleon III, liberating the Lombardy-Venetia. In 1866, Victor Emmanuel II aligned the kingdom with Prussia during the Austro-Prussian War, waging the Third Italian War of Independence which allowed Italy to annex Venice. In 1870, as France during the disastrous Franco-Prussian War abandoned its positions in Rome, Italy rushed to fill the power gap by taking over the Papal State from French sovereignty. Italian unification finally was achieved, and shortly afterwards Italy's capital was moved to Rome.[PARAGRAPH:2]As Northern Italy became industrialized and modernized, Southern Italy and agricultural regions of the north remained under-developed and stagnant, forcing millions of people to migrate to the emerging Industrial Triangle or abroad. The Sardinian Statuto Albertino of 1848, extended to the whole Kingdom of Italy in 1861, provided for basic freedoms, but the electoral laws excluded the non-propertied and uneducated classes from voting. In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted. The Socialist Party became the main political party, outclassing the traditional liberal and conservative organisations. The high point of Italian emigration was 1913, when 872,598 persons left Italy. Starting from the last two decades of the nineteenth century, Italy developed into a colonial power by forcing Somalia, Eritrea and later Libya and the Dodecanese under its rule. During World War I, Italy at first stayed neutral but in 1915 signed the Treaty of London, entering Entente on the promise of receiving Trento, Trieste, Istria, Dalmatia and parts of Ottoman Empire. During the war, 600,000 Italians died, and the economy collapsed. Under the Peace Treaty of Saint-Germain, Italy obtained just Bolzano-Bozen, Trento, Trieste and Istria in a victory described as "mutilated" by the public.[PARAGRAPH:2]The turbulence that followed the devastation of World War I, inspired by the Russian Revolution, led to turmoil and anarchy. The liberal establishment, fearing a socialist revolution, started to endorse the small National Fascist Party, led by Benito Mussolini. In October 1922 the fascists attempted a coup (the Marcia su Roma, "March on Rome"), but the king ordered the army not to intervene, instead forming an alliance with Mussolini. Over the next few years, Mussolini banned all political parties and curtailed personal liberties, thus forming a dictatorship. In 1935, Mussolini subjugated Ethiopia after a surprisingly lengthy campaign. This resulted in international alienation and the exodus of the country from the League of Nations. A first pact with Nazi Germany was concluded in 1936, and a second in 1938. Italy strongly supported Franco in the Spanish civil war. The country was opposed to Adolf Hitler's annexations of Austria, but did not interfere with it. Italy supported Germany's annexation of Sudetenland, however.[PARAGRAPH:2]On 7 April 1939 Italy occupied Albania, a de facto protectorate for decades, and entered World War II in 1940, taking part in the late stages of the Battle of France. Mussolini, wanting a quick victory like Hitler's blitzkriegs in Poland and France, invaded Greece in October 1940 via Albania but was forced to accept a humiliating defeat after a few months. At the same time, Italy, after initially conquering British Somalia, saw an allied counter-attack lead to the loss of all possessions in the Horn of Africa. Italy was also defeated by British forces in North Africa and was only saved by the urgently dispatched German Africa Corps led by Erwin Rommel. Italy was invaded by the Allies in June 1943, leading to the collapse of the fascist regime and the arrest of Mussolini. In September 1943, Italy surrendered. The country remained a battlefield for the rest of the war, as the allies were moving up from the south and the north was the base for loyalist Italian fascist and German Nazi forces. The whole picture became more complex by the activity of the Italian partisans; see Italian resistance movement. The Nazis left the country on 25 April 1945. This led to the eventual disbanding of Italian fascist forces.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1946, Vittorio Emanuele III's son, Umberto II, was forced to abdicate. Italy became a republic after a referendum held on 2 June 1946, a day celebrated since as Republic Day. This was the first election in Italy allowing women to vote. The Republican Constitution was approved and came into force on 1 January 1948. Under the Paris Peace Treaties of 1947, the eastern border area was lost to Yugoslavia, and, later, the free territory of Trieste was divided between the two states. Fears in the Italian electorate of a possible Communist takeover proved crucial for the first universal suffrage electoral outcome on the 18th of April 1948 when the Democrazia Cristiana, under the undisputed leadership of Alcide De Gasperi, won a resounding victory with 48 percent of the vote. In the 50s Italy became a member of the NATO alliance and an ally of the United States, which helped to revive the Italian economy through the Marshall Plan: until the 60s the country saw a period of prolonged economic growth termed the "Economic Miracle". In 1957, Italy was a signatory to the Treaties of Rome founding the European Economic Community (EEC), which became the European Union (EU) in 1993.[PARAGRAPH:2]From the late 1960s till late 1980s the country experienced a hard economic crisis and the Years of Lead, a period characterised by widespread social conflicts and terrorist acts carried out by extra-parliamentary movements. The Years of Lead culminated in the assassination of the Christian Democracy (DC) leader Aldo Moro in 1978, bringing to an end the "Historic Compromise" between the DC and the Communist Party. In the 1980s, for the first time since 1945, two governments were led by non-Christian-Democrat premiers: a republican (Giovanni Spadolini) and a socialist (Bettino Craxi); the DC remained, however, the main force supporting the government. The Socialist Party (PSI), led by Bettino Craxi, became more and more critical of the Communists and of the Soviet Union; Craxi himself pushed in favour of US president Ronald Reagan's positioning of Pershing missiles in Italy, a move the Communists hotly contested.[PARAGRAPH:2]From 1992 to 2009, Italy faced significant challenges, as voters, disenchanted with past political paralysis, massive government debt, extensive corruption, and organized crime's considerable influence (collectively called Tangentopoli after being uncovered by Mani pulite - "Clean hands") demanded political, economic, and ethical reforms. The scandals involved all major parties, but especially those in the government coalition: between 1992 and 1994 the DC underwent a severe crisis and was dissolved, splitting up into several pieces, while the PSI and the other governing minor parties completely dissolved. The 1994 elections put media magnate Silvio Berlusconi into the Prime Minister's seat. However, he was forced to step down in December when the Lega Nord Party withdrew its support. In April 1996, national elections led to the victory of a center-left coalition under the leadership of Romano Prodi. Prodi's first government became the third-longest to stay in power before he narrowly lost a vote of confidence, by three votes, in October 1998. A new government was formed by Massimo D'Alema, but in April 2000 he resigned. In 2001, national elections led to the victory of a center-right coalition under the leadership of Silvio Berlusconi, the center-right formed a government, and Silvio Berlusconi was able to remain in power for a complete five-year mandate, but with two different governments. The first one (2001&#150;2005) became the longest-lived government in post-war Italy. Italy participated in the US-led military coalition in Iraq. The elections in 2006 were won by the center-left, allowing Prodi to form his second government, but in early 2008 he resigned because of the collapse of his coalition. In the ensuing new early elections in April 2008, Silvio Berlusconi won to form a government for a fourth time.</English>

		<English>[TAB]A 'press' is an instrument that copies text onto a background such as paper using physical pressure. The printing press as we know it today was invented in Europe in the 1400s, with some earlier examples of less commercial success but comparable technical innovation around the world. At first, printing was used mainly to mass-produce books. However, it soon became apparent that printing could also be used to produce, on one or a few sheets of paper, cheap copies of advertisements, essays, or a regularly issued release of whatever events were of local interest. This last became known as a 'newspaper.'[PARAGRAPH:2]The first known printed newspaper was published in Strasbourg by Johann Carolus in 1605 (along with, within twelve weeks, the first editorial grumbling about the difficulty and expense of operating a newspaper). The practice of printing newspapers spread gradually over the 1600s. Early newspapers were often extremely propagandistic, sensational, and selective in their coverage, but over time a degree of what we now call journalistic ethics began to emerge - usually.[PARAGRAPH:2]Improvements in printing press technology allowed production of newspapers for the masses to begin in the 1800s; the advent of telegraphy in the 1840s further allowed news from across the nation to be put into a single daily paper every day. Over time the modern newspaper with its corps of reporters, typesetters, copy-editors, and so forth took shape. Virtually every city and town in the developed world would produce a newspaper on a daily or at least weekly basis, to be distributed en masse to the population as their main means of informing themselves about local and world events.[PARAGRAPH:2]Advances in radio and television took away some of the newspaper's uniqueness as a means of spreading information to the masses, but did not destroy the newspaper as an institution. Today's development of the Internet may be presenting still further danger to the newspaper's business model; it remains uncertain how organized daily news agencies will adapt to changing circumstances in the 21st century.</English>

		<English>[H1]Huayna Capac[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Sapa Inca of the Incan Empire[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1493 - 1527 AD[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Huayna Capac was the son of the Incan Emperor Iupanqui. Under his father, Capac led armies against his nation's neighbors to the north. When his father died in 1483 and he became emperor in his own right, Capac continued the campaigns, eventually extending the empire's borders into what is modern Colombia.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Inca Empire reached the height of its size and power under his rule, stretching over much of Bolivia, Peru, Argentine, Chile, Ecuador, and Colombia. It included varying terrain, from the high, frozen Andes to the densest swamps, and over 200 distinct ethnic groups, each with their own customs and languages.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite the geographical and cultural challenges, Inca - or Tawantinsuys, the "Realm of the Four Quarters" - was sophisticated for its time and place. At its height it had "monumental cities, temples and fortresses of stone, marvelously engineered roads cut through granite mountain slopes, and massive agricultural terraces and hydraulic works." A dedicated ruler, Huayna did much to improve the lives of his people. In addition to building temples and other works, Huayna greatly expanded the road network, along which he built storehouses for food so that aid could be quickly rushed to any who were in danger of starvation.[PARAGRAPH:2]Huayna contracted smallpox while campaigning in Colombia. Smallpox had been introduced to South America by the Spaniards, and the Native Americans had no defense against it; Huayna and about 200,000 other South and Central Americans died in that one epidemic. Before his death Huayna divided his country, leaving the newly-conquered north to his favorite son, Atahualpa, and the rest to his legitimate heir, Huascar. The two brothers fought a long and debilitating war to reunite their country. Atahualpa eventually won, but the victory left his country exhausted and prostrate, unable to withstand attack from the Spaniard; Francisco Pizarro.[PARAGRAPH:2]Very little is known about Huayna the man. As was their established practice, the Spanish conquerors did their best to obliterate Incan history in order to detach their subject people from their places in history and make them easier to enslave (and to be converted to Christianity). We know that Huayna was bloodthirsty and vindictive in war, but in his private life he was affectionate, even tender. We can assume that Huayna was smart enough to hold his empire together, ambitious enough to seek to extend its borders, ruthless enough to crush those in his path, and foolish enough to divide his empire to try to satisfy both of his sons.</English>

It was constructed in the mid-16th century at the orders of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, as a mausoleum for his wife.[PARAGRAPH:1]Acknowledged as one of the most beautiful structures in the world, the Taj Mahal is constructed of rare and brilliant materials imported from across India and Asia - it is said that over 1000 elephants were employed to carry the sandstone, marble, jade, turquoise, sapphires, and other materials used in its construction.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Taj Mahal complex covers an area of approximately 1000 feet by 1900 feet and consists of a gateway, garden, mausoleum, mosque, and guest house. The first three buildings are clad in white marble and covered with geometric patterns, while the mosque and guesthouse are built of brilliant red sandstone. The buildings are topped with magnificent onion-shaped domes and minarets.[PARAGRAPH:1]Experts have debated about what makes the Taj Mahal unique and beautiful. Some suggest that it lies in the structures' marvelous proportions and symmetry, while others argue in favor of the way that the marble buildings interact with the light, giving the Taj Mahal ever-changing character as the sun rises and sets. Still others believe that its inherent beauty lies in its purpose - a man seeking to cast in stone his love for his departed wife.</English>

Only shortly after his ascent to the throne Meiji married Lady Haruko who then became known as Empress Shoken, she was the first woman from the Imperial consort to be given the title kogo or emperor's wife. Shoken, however, bore him no children. Meiji did have children though, fifteen to be exact and to five different ladies in waiting.[PARAGRAPH:2]Though many think of the Meiji Restoration as "bloodless", there was in fact a great civil war fought within Japan shortly after his ascension to the throne. Imperial forces gathered under Meiji's rule and defeated the Tokugawa in the Boshin War of 1868-1869. It was at this time that Meiji moved the capital from Kyoto to Edo, which was then renamed Tokyo, and the Meiji period began in earnest. Though Meiji remained Emperor, the government had now become an oligarchy composed of the greatest military, political, and economic men of Japan.[PARAGRAPH:2]With the Meiji Restoration in progress, the Japanese had sent delegations and students around the world in order to learn and assimilate western arts and sciences; this was done not only to prevent Japan from falling under foreign domination but to enable Japan to compete equally with the Western powers. Sweeping changes were occuring ... although many powerful men from the Satsuma domain in northern Japan had risen to influential positions in the new Meiji government, there was growing dissatisfaction with the direction the country was taking. The modernization (westernization) of the country meant the abolition of the privileged social status of the samurai class and had undermined their financial position. The very rapid and massive changes to Japanese culture, dress, and society appeared to many samurai to be a betrayal of the joi ("expel the barbarian") portion of the Sonno joi justification used to overthrow the former Tokugawa shogunate in the Boshin War. This led to the Satsuma Rebellion, which was a revolt of samurai against the Meiji government from January 29, 1877 to September 24,1877, eleven years into the Meiji Era. It was the last, and the most serious, of a series of armed uprisings against the new government. In a tough series of battles, the samurai were finally defeated. Financially, crushing the Satsuma Rebellion cost the government greatly, forcing Japan off of the gold standard and causing the government to print paper currency. The rebellion was also effectively the end of the samurai class, as the new Imperial Japanese Army built of conscripts without regard to social class had proven itself in battle. Saigo Takamori was labeled as a tragic hero by the people and on February 22, 1889 Emperor Meiji pardoned Saigo posthumously.[PARAGRAPH:2]After securing internal peace, Japan began to reach outward towards imperial ambitions as a great power equal to western nations. The First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) was a war fought between Qing Dynasty China and Meiji Japan over the control of Korea which Japan won. The war demonstrated the superiority of Japanese tactics and training as a result of the adoption of a western style military, though it raised tensions between Japan and Russia, which in turn led to the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) and grew out of the rival imperialist ambitions of the Russian Empire and Japanese Empire over Manchuria and Korea. In the end, Japan sunk two of Russia's three fleets and defeated Russia in Manchuria, securing victory for Japan.[PARAGRAPH:2]Meiji himself was mainly a figure of leadership that helped the imperialists defeat the Tokugawa shogunate and restore peace to the people. His rule wasn't long, but he played enough part to help establish the Meiji era. It was the restoration that established Japan as a top power in the Pacific and helped it to maintain an important international presence. Little is known about Meiji himself including whether or not he wanted war or peace, or how much power he actually had during the revolution. It is said that the Emperor was more a symbol of unity to the people while it was his ministers that did the actual ruling. Though he may not of done much physically or verbally, his very presence did a lot. Emperor Meiji died in 1912 and was buried in the Graveyard (Fushimi Momoyama Ryo) in Kyoto. After his death, the end of the Meiji era left the people of Japan nervous and unsure of what the future might bring.[PARAGRAPH:2]Meiji symbolized the unity of the people under one government rising up to strike down the Tokugawa shogunate in order to establish a safer and more peaceful future. During his reign, Japan became an industrial power able to compete with the nations of the West. The Meiji shrine in the center of Tokyo was built in his honor.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_BUILDING_TURKIC_DIVAN_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]Divan is a Persian word in origin and loaned into Arabic. The original meaning was "bundle (of written sheets)", hence "book", especially "book of accounts," and hence "office of accounts," "custom house," "council chamber". [PARAGRAPH:2]A divan or diwan (in Arabic) was a high governmental intelligence agencies in a number of Islamic states, or its chief official. The first diwan was created under Caliph Umar I (A.D. 634鈥?44) between 636 and 641 A.D. It comprised the names of the warriors of Medina who participated in the Muslim conquests and their families, and was intended to facilitate the payment of salary, in coin or in rations to them, according to their service and their relationship to Muhammad. This first army register (diwan al-jund) was soon emulated in other provincial capitals like Basra, Kufa and Fustat. 	[PARAGRAPH:2]Under the Abbasid Caliphate, the administration, partly under the increasing influence of Iranian culture, became more and more elaborate and complex. As part of this process, the diwans increased in number and sophistication, reaching their apogee in the 9th鈥?0th centuries. At the same time, the office of vizier was also created to coordinate government. As the Abbasid Caliphate began to fragment in the 9th century, its administrative machinery was copied by the emergent successor dynasties, with the already extant local diwan branches likely providing the base on which the new administrations were formed. [PARAGRAPH:2]Many of the Turkish dynasties that emerged utilized the divan system to administrate more effectively their territories. In the Great Seljuk Empire, to compensate the frequent absence on campaign of the Seljuk sultans, the vizier assumed an even greater prominence, concentrating the direction of civil, military and religious affairs in his own bureau. The Divan-i H&#252;mayun or Sublime Porte was for many years the council of ministers of the Ottoman Empire. It consisted of the usually (except in the Sultan's presence) Grand Vizier, who presided, the other viziers, the kadi'askers, the nisanci, and the defterdars, and occasionally the Janissary Aga. The Assemblies of the Danubian Principalities (Ad hoc Divan) under Ottoman rule were also called "divan" ("Divanuri" in Romanian).</English>

		<Chinese>[TAB]Divan是一个波斯语单词，起源于阿拉伯语。原意是“书面文件包”，因此是“帐簿”，特别是“帐簿”，因此是“帐簿办公室”、“海关”、“会议厅”。[段落：2 ]一个DIVAN或DIWAN（阿拉伯语）是一些伊斯兰国家的高级政府情报机构，或其首席官员。第一个迪旺是在公元636年至641年的哈里发乌马尔一世（公元634-644年）统治下创建的。它包含了参加穆斯林征服的麦地那战士及其家人的名字，旨在根据他们的服务和与穆罕默德的关系，方便他们支付工资、硬币或口粮。第一批军队登记册（diwan al-jund）很快在巴士拉、库法和福斯塔特等其他省会城市效仿。〔2〕在阿巴斯王朝统治下，政府在伊朗文化的影响下，变得越来越复杂和复杂。作为这一过程的一部分，迪旺人在数量和复杂程度上都有所增加，在9-10世纪达到了顶峰。同时，还设立了维齐尔办公室，以协调政府。随着阿巴斯哈里发在9世纪开始分裂，其行政机构被新兴的继承王朝所仿效，现存的地湾支部可能为新的行政机构的形成提供了基础。[段落：2 ]许多土耳其王朝的出现利用了DIVAN系统来更有效地管理他们的领土。在伟大的塞尔柱帝国中，为了弥补塞尔柱苏丹经常缺席的战役，维齐尔占据了更重要的地位，将民政、军事和宗教事务的方向集中在他自己的局中。多年来，迪凡-伊赫玛雍（Divan-i humayun）或崇高门（Sublime Porte）一直是奥斯曼帝国的部长会议。它由通常（苏丹在场的情况除外）主持的大维齐尔、其他维齐尔、卡迪阿斯克、尼桑奇和德夫特尔达，偶尔还有贾尼萨里阿加组成。在奥斯曼帝国统治下的多努比亚公国（特别迪凡）集会也被称为“迪凡”（罗马尼亚语中的“迪凡努里”）。</Chinese>

It has the same root as the word "template," a plan in preparation of the building that was marked out on the ground by the augur. Templa also became associated with the dwelling places of a god or gods. Despite the specific set of meanings associated with the religion of the ancient Rome, the word has now become quite widely used to describe a house of worship for any number of religions and is even used for time periods prior to the Romans.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Hacienda is a Spanish word for an estate. Some haciendas were plantations, mines or factories. Many haciendas combined these productive activities. The hacienda aimed for self-sufficiency in everything but luxuries meant for display, which were destined for the handful of people in the circle of the patr&#243;n, also known as the hacendado.[PARAGRAPH:1]Haciendas originated in land grants, mostly made to conquistadors. It is in Mexico that the hacienda system can be considered to have its origin in 1529, when the Spanish crown granted to Hern&#225;n Cort&#233;s the title of Marquess of the Valley of Oaxaca, which entailed a tract of land that included all of the present state of Morelos. Significantly, Cort&#233;s was also granted an encomienda, which included all the Native Americans then living on the land, and with power of life and death every person on his domains.</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_CIV_PERSIA_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]The term Persia has been used for centuries, chiefly in the West, to designate a region of southern Iran formerly known as Persis or Parsa; the name of the Indo-European nomadic people who migrated into the region about 1000 BC, eventually supplanting the Assyrians and Chaldeans. The first mention of the Parsa occurs in the annals of Shalmanesar III, an Assyrian king, in 844 BC. Cyrus II (559-529 BC), also known as Cyrus the Great, was heir to a long line of ruling chiefs in Mesopotamia and was the founder of the Persian Empire; he was called the father of his people by the ancient Persians. In 550 BC, Cyrus, the Prince of Persia, revolted against the Median king Astyages and welded the Persians and Medes together into one powerful force. Cyrus consolidated his rule on the Iranian Plateau and then extended it westward across Asia Minor. In October 539 BC, Babylon, the greatest city of the ancient world, fell to his Persian forces. Cyrus also oversaw the construction of a series of great roads to link together the territories that he had conquered. Although Cyrus was a great military conqueror, he was also a fair ruler; he allowed the Jews to return from Babylon to their homeland in Palestine. His dynasty, known as the Achaemenids, ruled Persia for two centuries.[PARAGRAPH:2]Following the death of Cyrus' heir, Darius I (522-486 BC), a leading general and one of the princes of the Achaemenid family, proclaimed himself king following the suppression of a number of provincial rebellions and challenges from other pretenders to the throne. Darius was in the mold of Cyrus the Great - a powerful personality and a dynamic ruler. To consolidate his accession, Darius I founded his new capital of Parsa, known to the Greeks as Persepolis ("Persian City") and expanded the ranks of his personal bodyguard, the Immortals. The elite force drew its name from the fact that no matter how many men were lost, the Persian Emperor would always pay the cost to restore the Immortals back to their original strength. Although Darius consolidated and added to the conquests of his predecessors, it was as an administrator that he made his greatest contribution to Persian history. During his reign, political and legal reforms revitalized the provinces and ambitious projects were undertaken to promote imperial trade and commerce; coinage, weights and measures were standardized, and new land and sea routes explored and established.[PARAGRAPH:2]Such activities, however, did not prevent Darius from following an active expansionist policy. Campaigns in the east confirmed gains made by Cyrus the Great and added large sections of the northern Indian subcontinent to the list of Persian-controlled provinces. Expansion to the west began about 516 BC when Darius moved against the Greek colonies along the coast of Asia Minor. Xerxes (486-465 BC), son and successor of Darius I, was determined to continue the Persian conquest of the west and is best known for his massive invasion of Greece from across the Hellespont in 480 BC, a campaign marked by the battles of Thermopylae, Salamis, and Plataea. Although successful in the pacification of Egypt and suppression of a Babylon revolt, his defeat by the allied Greek city-states spelled the beginning of the decline of the Persian Empire. In Xerxes' last years, he squandered the once-enormous treasury he had gathered through trade and taxation by launching vast construction programs, most never finished.[PARAGRAPH:2]The death of Xerxes was the final turning point in Persian influence. Occasional flashes of vigor and ability by some of Xerxes' successors were too infrequent to prevent eventual collapse. The final act was played out during the reign of Darius III (336-330 BC), who was defeated at the Battle of Granicus (334 BC) by Alexander the Great. Persepolis fell to the young Macedonian conqueror in April 330 BC, and Darius, the last Achaemenid, was murdered in the summer of the same year while fleeing the Greek forces. In the struggle for power after Alexander's death, Seleucus I brought under his control the Persian provinces of Alexander's empire. But this unity was short-lived, as the Indian holdings successfully revolted and the Seleucid kingdom broke into the competing nations of Parthia and Bactria. Parts of the Seleucid kingdom lasted for two centuries, but it was eventually swept aside by the Parthians, who founded an empire that stretched almost as far as Persia under the Achaemenids. The Romans and Parthians struggled against one another for centuries over control of Mesopotamia, with the Parthians usually holding onto most of the Fertile Crescent. But in 224 AD the Parthians were themselves overthrown by a new Sassanid dynasty that revived many of the customs of the Achaemenids, such as the Zoroastrian religion. The Sassanids fought a series of debilitating wars with the Byzantine Empire in the 6th and 7th centuries, which fatally weakened the Persian Empire when the Arabs exploded onto the scene. In a series of decisive battles between 633 and 642, the Arabs conquered and destroyed the Persian Empire; since this time, Persia (modern Iran) has largely belonged to the Arab world. The customs and religion of ancient Persia were destroyed and the population absorbed into the surrounding Islamic culture; only a few remnants survive today.</English>

		<Chinese>波斯一词几个世纪以来主要流行于西方，指今天伊朗南部地区。此前，这里以“波西斯”和“帕沙”而闻名，两者都是印欧游牧民族的名字。公元前1000年左右他们迁移到这里，最终取代了亚述人和迦勒底人。“帕沙”一词最早见于有关公元前844年亚述国王萨尔曼尼撒三世的史料。居鲁士二世（前559-前529在位，即居鲁士大帝），美索不达米亚一系列统治者的后裔，是位宽宏大量并受人尊敬的君主，古波斯人称其为民族之父。公元前550年，居鲁士领导波斯部族成功推翻米底亚王阿斯蒂亚格斯的统治，将米底亚与波斯结为一体。随后他巩固了在伊朗高原的统治并向西扩张到了小亚细亚。前539年10月，远古时代世上最伟大的城市巴比伦落入波斯军队之手。居鲁士还下令修建了大量驿道，以将他所征服的辽阔土地联结在一起。居鲁士不但是一位强大的军事征服者，还是一位公正的统治者，他允许被掠至巴比伦的犹太人返回他们在巴勒斯旦的家园。他所建立的阿契明王朝在此后两个世纪一直统治着整个波斯。[PARAGRAPH:2]随着居鲁士继承人的死亡，一位帝国的高级将领，同时也是阿契明家族的王子大流士一世（前522-前486在位）镇压了各省的叛乱分子和觑觎王位者后自封为国王。大流士同居鲁士大帝相似，是位强悍有力，精力充沛的统治者。为了巩固他的王位，大流士一世在帕沙建立了他的新首都，希腊人称之为波斯波利斯（“波斯之城”），并大大扩充了他的私人近卫队，即波斯长生军。这个名字是对这些战士的恰当褒奖，因为他们作战勇猛、奋不顾身，长生军在任何时候都必须保持满员状态，不论这将付出多少代价。虽然大流士巩固并扩大了前代帝王的征服事业，但他为波斯历史所做的最伟大贡献则是作为一位治国者的功绩。在他统治时期，政治和法律改革令所有省份均充满生机，很多雄心勃勃的计划得以实行，促进了帝国的贸易和商业，货币和度量衡得以统一，新的陆地、海洋贸易线路得以开拓和建立。[PARAGRAPH:2]然而，这些活动没有防碍大流士积极的扩张政策。东方的战役巩固了居鲁士大帝的成就，使北方印度次大陆的大片土地进入波斯控制的省份之列。向西方的扩张始于公元前516年，当时大流士对小亚细亚沿岸的希腊殖民地发动了进攻。薛西斯（前486-前465在位），大流士一世的儿子和继承人，决定继续波斯对西方的征服。他最著名的事迹是公元前480年越过海峡对希腊的大举入侵，期间在温泉关，萨拉米斯湾和普拉蒂亚展开了一系列的大战。虽然成功平定了埃及，并镇压了巴比伦的起义，但他却被希腊各城邦组成的联盟击败了，这标志着波斯帝国开始走向衰落。由于对这些失利感到失望，薛西斯在苏萨和波斯波利斯的宫殿中过起了引退生活。在最后的几年里，他把从贸易和税赋中获得的巨额财富全部耗费在了庞大的建筑工程上，但大多数都未能完成。[PARAGRAPH:2]薛西斯之死是波斯影响力的最后转折点。尽管他的一些继承者也偶而闪现出一些活力和能力，但毕竟极为少见，无法阻止最终的衰落。大流士三世统治时期（前336-前330）成为古代波斯帝国历史的最后一章。大流士三世在前330年的格拉尼卡斯河战役惨败于亚历山大大帝，帝国开始走向穷途末路。最终波斯波利斯于前330年4月被年轻的马其顿征服者占领。阿契明王朝的末代国王大流士也于同年在逃亡途中被谋杀。在亚历山大死后爆发的权力争斗中，由塞琉古斯一世建立的塞琉西王国控制了原属亚历山大帝国的波斯诸省。但是统一持续的时间非常短暂，印度地区很快宣告叛离，其余大部分地区也分立为帕提亚（中国史籍称为安息）和巴克特里亚（中国史籍称为大夏）两个敌对国家。日益衰落的塞琉西王国在延续两个世纪之后被帕提亚所灭，此时的帕提亚基本控制了原属波斯阿契明王朝的所有领土。罗马人为争夺美索不达米亚的统治权同帕提亚进行了上百年的战争，却几乎没有占到任何便宜。到公元224年，帕提亚又被萨珊王朝所推翻，萨珊王朝与当初的阿契明王朝有较深的渊源，且同样信仰琐罗亚斯德教（拜火教）。在公元6世纪至7世纪间，萨珊王朝与拜占庭帝国进行了长期的战争，国力因此严重削弱，阿拉伯人则乘势崛起。经过633年至642年一系列决定性的战役，阿拉伯人征服了波斯萨珊王朝，从此之后，波斯（今伊朗）成为阿拉伯世界的一部分。古代波斯的风俗和信仰被消灭了，大部分人口融入了伊斯兰文化，只剩下少量遗迹保存至今。</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]The Dome of the Rock is located at the visual center of an ancient man-made platform known as the Temple Mount, which Muslims refer to as the "Noble Sanctuary". The platform, greatly enlarged under the rule of Herod the Great, is the site of the Second Jewish Temple which was destroyed during the Roman Siege of Jerusalem in 70 AD. In 637 AD, Jerusalem was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate army during the Islamic invasion of the Byzantine Empire.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Dome of the Rock was erected between 685 and 691 AD. The names of the two engineers in charge of the project are given as: Yazid Ibn Salam from Jerusalem and Raja Ibn Haywah from Baysan. Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan who initiated construction of the Dome, hoped that it would "house the Muslims from cold and heat" and intended the building to serve as a shrine for pilgrims and not as a mosque for public worship. Historians contend that the Caliph wished to create a structure which would compete with the existing buildings of other religions in the city. al-Maqdisi writes that he "Sought to build for the Muslims a masjid that should be unique and a wonder to the world. And in like manner, is it not evident that Caliph Abd al-Malik, seeing the greatness of the martyrium of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and its magnificence was moved lest it should dazzle the minds of Muslims and hence erected above the Rock the dome which is now seen there."[PARAGRAPH:1]During the Crusades the Dome of the Rock was given to the Augustinians, who turned it into a church, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque became the royal palace of Baldwin I of Jerusalem in 1104. The Knights Templar, who believed the Dome of the Rock was the site of the Temple of Solomon, set up their headquarters in the Al-Aqsa Mosque adjacent to the Dome for much of the 12th century. The "Templum Domini," as they called it, was featured on the official seals of the Order's Grand Masters, and it became the architectural model for Templar churches across Europe.[PARAGRAPH:1]Jerusalem was recaptured by Saladin on Friday, 2 October 1187 and the Haram was reconsecrated as a Muslim sanctuary. The cross on top of the Dome of the Rock was replaced by a golden crescent and a wooden screen was placed around the rock below. Salah al-Din's nephew al-Malik al-Mu'azzam Isa (615-24/1218-27) carried out other restorations within the Haram and added the porch to the Aqsa mosque.[PARAGRAPH:1]Large-scale renovation was undertaken during the reign of Mahmud II in 1817. Adjacent to the Dome of the Rock, the Ottomans built the free-standing Dome of the Prophet in 1620.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Dome of the Rock was badly shaken during an earthquake in Palestine on Monday, 11 July 1927 rendering useless many of the repairs that had taken place over previous years.[PARAGRAPH:1]Under Jordanian rule of Jerusalem, Jews were forbidden from entering the Old City. Israel took control of the Dome of the Rock during its victory in the Six-Day War in 1967. A few hours after the Israeli flag was hoisted over the Dome of the Rock in 1967, at the conclusion of the Six-Day War, Israelis lowered it on the orders of General Moshe Dayan, and invested the Muslim Waqf (religious trust) with the authority to manage the Temple Mount-Haram al-Sharif in order to "keep the peace".[PARAGRAPH:1]The Dome of the Rock, being among a complex of buildings on the Temple Mount, (the other principal building being the Al-Aqsa Mosque) is one of the holiest sites in Islam, following Mecca, Medina, and, for shia Muslims, the Imam Ali Mosque. Its significance stems from the religious beliefs regarding the rock at its heart. According to Islamic tradition, the rock is the spot from where Muhammad ascended to Heaven accompanied by the angel Gabriel.[PARAGRAPH:1]The stone over which the Muslim shrine, the Dome of Rock, was built is the holiest site in Judaism. Jews have traditionally regarded the location of the stone as the holiest spot on Earth, the site of the Holy of Holies during the Temple Period. In former times, some Jewish scholars thought that the location of the Holy of Holies was not known for certain. Today this is a minority opinion.[PARAGRAPH:1]Just as Muslims pray towards the Kaaba at Mecca, the holiest site in Islam, Jews pray towards the site of the ancient Holy of Holies, the Foundation Stone, the holiest site in Judaism.[PARAGRAPH:1]In Christianity it is believed that during the time of the Byzantine Empire, nearby the spot where the Dome was later constructed was where Constantine's mother built a small church, calling it the Church of St. Cyrus and St. John, later on enlarged and called the Church of the Holy Wisdom. On the walls of the Dome of the Rock is an inscription in a mosaic frieze that includes the following words:[PARAGRAPH:1]"Bless your envoy and your servant Jesus son of Mary and peace upon him on the day of birth and on the day of death and on the day he is raised up again. It is a word of truth in which they doubt. It is not for God to take a son. Glory be to him when he decrees a thing he only says be, and it is."</English>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_RELIGION_ORTHODOXY_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>[TAB]Orthodoxy is one of the three major divisions (Catholicism, Orthodoxy, and Protestantism) within Christianity. Catholicism and Orthodoxy got officially separated after many years of debates and arguments in the Great Schism in 1054[PARAGRAPH:2]In classical Christian usage, the term orthodox refers to a set of doctrines which gained prominence in the 4th century AD. The Roman Emperor Constantine I initiated a series of ecumenical councils to try to standardize what was by then, not a necessarily homogeneous religion in terms of theology. The most significant of these early debates was that between the Homoousian doctrine of Athanasius and Eustathius (Trinitarianism) and the Heteroousian doctrine of Arius and Eusebius (Arianism).[PARAGRAPH:2]The Homoousian doctrine gradually won out in the Roman Church and came to be referred to as orthodoxy in most Christian contexts, since this became the viewpoint of the majority (although, of course, many non-Trinitarian Christians still object to this terminology). Following the Great Schism, both the Western and Eastern churches continued to consider themselves uniquely orthodox and catholic. Over time the Western church gradually identified itself more with the "Catholic" label and Westerners gradually associated the "Orthodox" label more with the Eastern church (in some other languages the "Catholic" label is not necessarily identified with the Western church). In addition to the Eastern Orthodox Church, there also exists a separate Oriental Orthodox communion, as well as other smaller communions that are commonly associated with the "Orthodox" label.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Eastern Orthodox Church uses the original form of the Nicene Creed created at the First Council of Constantinople in 381, in contrast to the Roman Catholic church, which uses the Nicene creed with the addition of the phrase 'and the Son'. This change is one of many causes for the Great Schism formalized in 1054 by simultaneous proclamations of "Anathema" from the leadership of the Orthodox Churches in the East and the Bishop of Rome (Pope) in the West. This emphasis on the use of the original "creed" is shared today by all Eastern Orthodox Christians.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Orthodox Church is composed of several self-governing ecclesial bodies, each geographically and nationally distinct but theologically unified. Each self-governing (or autocephalous) body, often but not always encompassing a nation, is shepherded by a synod of bishops whose duty, among other things, is to preserve and teach the Apostolic and patristic traditions and related church practices. As in the Roman Catholic Church, Anglican Church, Assyrian Church of the East, Oriental Orthodoxy and some other churches, Orthodox bishops trace their lineage back to the Apostles through the process of Apostolic Succession.</English>

At his death, Temujin's empire encompassed over 13.8 million square miles and 100 million people, about half of the world's entire population.[PARAGRAPH:2]Temujin was born into a family of the minor Mongol nobility. His father was murdered when he was nine, leaving his mother to teach Temujin how to ride a horse, shoot a bow, and tend the animals. She also taught her son that allies were crucial to one's survival, and Temujin took this lesson to heart. By the time Temujin had reached his late teens, he had gathered to him a group of very loyal vassals, with whom he shared the spoils of his wars. He also became blood brothers with men from the leading Mongol families. However, Temujin was first and foremost a pragmatist; he would remain friends with these leaders as long as it suited him and he would discard or betray them at need.[PARAGRAPH:2]Temujin grew in power and prominence, and he was eventually accepted as leader of all of the Mongols. He reorganized the military, promoting men of competence rather than men of good breeding. This gave him the unwavering backing of the common soldiers and the officers. After defeating his last internal foe, Temujin was named "Genghis Kahn," meaning either "Oceanic Ruler" (or possibly "Fierce Ruler"). After fully securing his position at home, Kahn began his extraordinary series of conquests across Asia and Europe.[PARAGRAPH:2]Genghis Khan was far more interested in victory than he was in glory in battle. Before attacking a city or country, Genghis Khan sent the local rulers "orders of submission," in which he demanded immediate surrender. If the rulers did so, they were allowed to continue governing as long as they provided him tribute in money and labor. If the rulers did not surrender, they could expect little mercy once defeated.[PARAGRAPH:2]As a political leader, Genghis Kahn adopted a policy of religious tolerance, which eased tensions with the local priests. He recruited foreigners to serve as officers in his army and in his government, allowing them to rise to prominence according to their abilities, thus giving the ablest men reason to support him rather than to plot against him. He issued a set of laws for his conquered lands, which among other things punished horse theft with death and imposed severe punishment on disobedient soldiers. He also allowed full trade with Europe, and for the first time it was possible for European merchants to travel all the way to China in (relative) safety.[PARAGRAPH:2]As a military leader, Genghis Khan was exceptional. He maintained tight discipline among his troops, punishing them severely for infractions. He developed a sophisticated intelligence network across Asia, and he used the intelligence to craft clever military campaigns that fully exploited his enemy's weaknesses. Genghis Khan's troops were extraordinary, as well. The Mongols were superb light cavalrymen, and their ability to shoot arrows from the saddle was unbelievable. At first his armies were ignorant of the arts of siege warfare, but as more and more armies refused to meet his forces in the open field; his men grew skilled with catapults and the other tools for fighting men behind walls.[PARAGRAPH:2]Genghis Khan's first campaigns were against the Tanguts, who controlled the lucrative trade routes between the East and West. After subduing them, he conquered other foes in Central Asia and Northern China. No one could stand against him. During his last and most extraordinary campaign, he set out with 200,000 warriors and captured Bukhara, Samarkand, Balkh, Nishapur and Herat in succession. After remaining in Central Asia for four years, Genghis Khan headed back home, only to die en route.[PARAGRAPH:2]Something more than a barbarian and something less than an enlightened ruler, Genghis Khan remains one of the most extraordinary warrior-kings of all time.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev is an outstanding architectural monument of Kievan Rus'. Today, it is one of the city's best known landmarks and the first Ukrainian patrimony to be inscribed on the World Heritage List.[PARAGRAPH:2]The cathedral's name comes from the 6th-century Hagia Sophia cathedral in Constantinople (meaning Holy Wisdom, and dedicated to the Holy Wisdom of God rather than a specific saint named Sophia). According to a less popular theory, its model was the 13-domed oaken Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod (ca. 989), which Yaroslav I the Wise determined to imitate in stone as a sign of gratitude to the citizens of Novgorod who had helped him secure the Kievan throne in 1019.[PARAGRAPH:2]The first foundations were laid in 1037, but the cathedral took two decades to complete. The structure has 5 naves, 5 apses, and (quite surprisingly for Byzantine architecture) 13 cupolas. It is surrounded by two-tier galleries from three sides. Measuring 37 to 55 m (121 to 180 ft), the exterior used to be faced with plinths. On the inside, it retains mosaics and frescos from the eleventh century, including a dilapidated representation of Yaroslav's family, and the Virgin Orans.[PARAGRAPH:2]Originally the cathedral was a burial place of the Kievan rulers including Vladimir Monomakh, Vsevolod Yaroslavich and of course the cathedral's founder Yaroslav I the Wise, although only the latter's grave survived to our days.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the pillaging of Kiev by Andrei Bogolyubsky of Vladimir-Suzdal in 1169, followed by Mongolian Tatars in 1240, the cathedral fell into disrepair. Following the 1595-96 Union of Brest, the cathedral of Saint Sophia belonged to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church until it was claimed by the Moldavian Orthodox metropolitan Peter Mogila (Mohyla) in 1633. Mogila commissioned the repair work and the upper part of the building was thoroughly rebuilt, modeled by the Italian architect Octaviano Mancini in the distinct Ukrainian Baroque style, while preserving the Byzantine interior, keeping its splendor intact. The work continued under the Cossack Hetman Ivan Mazepa, and in 1740 the Cathedral was completed to its present form.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the Russian Revolution of 1917 and during the Soviet antireligious campaign of the 1920s, the government plan called for the cathedral's destruction and transformation of the grounds into a park "Heroes of Perekop" (after a Red Army victory in the Russian Civil War in Crimea). The cathedral was saved from destruction primarily with the effort of many scientists and historians. Nevertheless, in 1934, Soviet authorities confiscated the structure from the church, including the surrounding seventeenth-eighteenth century architectural complex and designated it as an architectural and historical museum.[PARAGRAPH:2]Since the late 1980s Soviet, and later Ukrainian, politicians promised to return the building to the Orthodox Church. Due to various schisms and factions within the Church the return was postponed as all Orthodox and the Greek-Catholic Churches lay claim to it. Although all of the Orthodox churches have been allowed to conduct services at different dates, other times they are denied access. Most memorable was the funeral of Patriarch Volodymyr of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchy, when riot police were forced to prevent the burial on the premises of the museum and a bloody clash took place. After events such as those no religious body has yet been given the rights for regular services. The complex now remains a museum of Ukraine's Christianity, with most of its visitors being tourists.[PARAGRAPH:2]The complex of the Cathedral is the main component the National Sanctuary "Sophia of Kiev" the state institution responsible for the preservation of the Cathedral complex along with several other historic landmarks of the city.</English>

Two engines on each arm of a cruciform plan, with an elaborate Byzantine style, described as The Cathedral of Sewage. Another of Bazalgette's designs, Crossness Pumping Station, is located south of the River Thames at Crossness, at the end of the Southern Outfall Sewer. A modern pumping station (F Station) was completed in 1997 about 200 metres (660 ft) south of the original station.[PARAGRAPH:2]The pumping station was built at the site of an earlier watermill owned by the former Stratford Langthorne Abbey, from which it gained its name. It was first recorded as Wiggemulne in 1312, i.e., "the mill of a man called Wicga", an Old English personal name, and subsequently became associated with the abbey. The Abbey lay between the Channelsea River and Marsh Lane (Manor Road). It was dissolved in 1538. By 1840, the North Woolwich railway ran through the site, and it began to be used to establish factories, and ultimately the sewage pumping stations.[PARAGRAPH:2]The pumps raised the sewage in the London sewerage system between the two Low Level Sewers and the Northern Outfall Sewer, which was built in the 1860s to carry the increasing amount of sewage produced in London away from the centre of the city. Two Moorish styled chimneys - unused since steam power had been replaced by electric motors in 1933 - were demolished in 1941, as it was feared that a strike from German bombs might topple them onto the pumping station.

		<English>[H1]Basil II[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Emperor of the Byzantine Empire[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 958 - 1025 AD[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Basil II, known in his time as Basil the Porphyrogenitus and Basil the Young to distinguish him from his ancestor Basil I the Macedonian, was a Byzantine emperor from the Macedonian dynasty who reigned from 10 January 976 to 15 December 1025.[PARAGRAPH:2]The first part of his long reign was dominated by civil war against powerful generals from the Anatolian aristocracy. Following their submission, Basil oversaw the stabilization and expansion of the Byzantine Empire's eastern frontier, and above all, the final and complete subjugation of Bulgaria, the Empire's foremost European foe, after a prolonged struggle. For this he was nicknamed by later authors as "the Bulgar-slayer", by which he is popularly known. At his death, the Empire stretched from Southern Italy to the Caucasus and from the Danube to the borders of Palestine, its greatest territorial extent since the Muslim conquests, four centuries earlier.[PARAGRAPH:2]Despite near-constant warfare, Basil also showed himself a capable administrator, reducing the power of the great land-owning families who dominated the Empire's administration and military, and filling the Empire's treasury. Of far-reaching importance was Basil's decision to offer the hand of his daughter Anna to Vladimir I of Kiev in exchange for military support, which led to the Christianization of the Kievan Rus', and the incorporation of Russia within the Byzantine cultural sphere.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Tolerance is the acceptance of an action, object, or person which one dislikes or disagrees with, where one is in a position to disallow it but chooses not to. It has also been defined as "to bear or endure" or "to nourish, sustain or preserve" or as "a fair, objective, and permissive attitude toward those whose opinions, beliefs, practices, racial or ethnic origins, etc., differ from one's own; freedom from bigotry" too. Toleration may signify "no more than forbearance and the permission given by the adherents of a dominant religion for other religions to exist, even though the latter are looked on with disapproval as inferior, mistaken, or harmful."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]There is only one verb to tolerate and one adjective tolerant, but the two nouns tolerance and toleration have evolved slightly different meanings. Tolerance is a state of mind that implies non-judgmental acceptance of different lifestyles or beliefs, whereas toleration indicates the act of putting up with something that one disapproves of. Historically, most incidents and writings pertaining to toleration involve the status of minority and dissenting viewpoints in relation to a dominant state religion.</English>

		<English>[H1]Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Leader of the Indian Independence Movement[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 1869 - 1948 AD[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Mohandas Gandhi was born in an India under British rule. The son of the Prime Minister of the small state of Porbandar, in his youth Gandhi displayed none of the brilliance that would mark him as an adult; in fact the young man was a mediocre student and quite shy. He entered into an arranged marriage at the age of 13, the usual custom of the period. Apparently he did not enjoy the experience, later calling the practice "the cruel custom of child marriage."[PARAGRAPH:2]Upon graduating from high school, Gandhi decided to follow his father into state service. To this end he decided he would go to England to study. His father having just died, Gandhi's mother did not want him to go, allowing him only after he had promised to abstain from wine, women, and meat. His caste looked upon traveling over the ocean as unclean; when he persisted they declared him an outcast. He learned much about England and the English during his time in that country, knowledge which was to prove invaluable later in his career. In 1891 Gandhi passed the bar and set sail for India. He attempted to set up practice in Bombay, but was unsuccessful and shortly relocated to South Africa.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gandhi enjoyed more professional success in South Africa, but he was appalled by the racial bigotry and intolerance he found there. He would spend the next twenty years of his life in South Africa looking after the interests of all under-classes, not just the Indians. It was here that Gandhi began to refine and teach his philosophy of passive resistance. He was jailed several times for his resistance to the so-called "Black Acts," by which all non-whites were required to submit their fingerprints to the government. When the government ruled that only Christian marriages were legal in South Africa, Gandhi organized and led a massive non-violent protest, which eventually caused the government to back down. It was here that Gandhi acquired the title of "Mahatma," which means a person venerated for great knowledge and love of humanity.[PARAGRAPH:2]In 1915, Gandhi returned to India. He shocked the world when he expressed his humiliation that he had to speak English in his native land, and he shocked the Indian nobility when he chided them for their ostentatiousness, telling them that they should hold their jewels and wealth in trust for their countrymen.[PARAGRAPH:2] Thus Gandhi began his long campaign to free his country from English rule. He followed two paths - he shamed oppressors and he demanded sacrifice from his people. For the next thirty years Gandhi was to tirelessly exhort his people to passive resistance, leading strike after strike, march after march, fasting himself to the point of incapacity, enduring innumerable beatings, and months and even years in prison. At one point he made a historic trip to England, where he won over much of the English working and middle classes, to the great irritation of the government. Despite innumerable setbacks and years of endless toil, he persisted. In 1946, exhausted and virtually bankrupt by World War II, the English agreed to vacate India, but in doing so divided the country between Hindu and Muslims, which Gandhi abhorred.[PARAGRAPH:2]The partition sparked an outbreak of religious violence, in which Muslims were massacred wholesale in India, and the same fate awaited Hindus in Pakistan. The countries were in chaos. In response, Gandhi went on a fast, refusing to eat again until the violence ceased. Astonishingly, his fast worked: the peoples of India and Pakistan were unwilling to see their great hero die, and they sent him letters and representatives promising to stop the killings and begging him to end the fast. He did so, to the relief of millions. Twelve days later, Gandhi was assassinated.</English>

After the Xianfeng Emperor's death in 1861, the young boy became the Tongzhi Emperor, and she became the Empress Dowager. Cixi ousted a group of regents appointed by the late emperor and assumed regency, which she shared with Empress Dowager Ci'an. Cixi then consolidated control over the dynasty when she installed her nephew as the Guangxu Emperor at the death of the Tongzhi Emperor in 1875, contrary to the traditional rules of succession of the Qing dynasty that had ruled China since 1644.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although Cixi refused to adopt Western models of government, she supported technological and military reforms and the Self-Strengthening Movement. Although she agreed with the principles of the Hundred Days' Reforms of 1898, Cixi rejected their sudden implementation, without bureaucratic support, as detrimental to dynastic power. She placed the Guangxu Emperor, who had tried to assassinate her, under virtual house arrest for supporting radical reformers. She may have feared that any perceived weakness in the Imperial Court would have been pounced upon by the Japanese. After the Boxer Uprising led to invasion by Allied armies, Cixi initially backed the Boxer groups for supporting the dynasty and attacking the foreigners. The ensuing Allied defeat of the Chinese forces was a stunning humiliation. When Cixi returned to Beijing from Xi'an, where she had taken the emperor, she became friendly to foreigners in the capital and began to implement fiscal and institutional reforms that began to turn China into a constitutional monarchy. The death of both Cixi and the Guangxu Emperor in 1908 left the court in the hands of Manchu conservatives, a child, Puyi, on the throne, and a restless, rebellious public.</English>

		<English>[H1]Hannibal Barca[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Carthaginian Military Commander[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived:[\BOLD] 247 - 183 BC[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Among the great captains of military history, few stand as high, and none higher, than Hannibal Barca. He was born the son of Hamilcar Barca in 247 BC, shortly before the Carthaginian defeat in the First Punic War. Hamilcar made it his mission to conquer new territory in Hispania (Spain) to make up for the loss of Sicily to the Romans; when Hannibal grew old enough, he joined his father and learned the art of military command. According to legend, at this time Hannibal swore an oath of eternal vengeance on Rome.[PARAGRAPH:2]After the death of his father and brother-in-law, Hannibal was acclaimed the commander of the Carthaginian forces in Hispania in 221 BC. He spent the next two years finishing the subjugation of the region, and then in 219 BC he attacked the town of Sagentum. Hannibal had been looking for a bigger fight: the city was under the protection of Rome and his attack was sure to spark a diplomatic incident. In fact, the situation boiled out of control and Rome declared war on Carthage, thus beginning the Second Punic War.[PARAGRAPH:2]As soon as he heard that war had broken out, Hannibal resolved to embark on a daring raid into Italy itself. He gathered together his most reliable soldiers from Africa and Iberia and set out to the east. After crossing the Pyrenees and evading a Roman army in southern Gaul, in 218 BC Hannibal led his troops on a heroic crossing of the Alps, an astonishing feat that no one at the time thought possible and which caught the Romans totally by surprise.[PARAGRAPH:2]Once he emerged on the other side of the mountains, Hannibal found shelter among the Gauls of the Po River. With these new allies replacing the many soldiers who had died in the difficult crossing, Hannibal fought a Roman army at the Trebia River, cutting it to pieces by a surprise flank attack. The following year in 217 BC, he crossed the Apennine Mountains and headed into central Italy, where at the Battle of Lake Trasimene he fought and destroyed the main Roman army. Now there was no force in all of Italy which could stand in his way.[PARAGRAPH:2]The road to Rome was now open, but Hannibal had no siege weapons and he knew that the had no chance to take the city. Instead, he headed into the south of Italy and ravaged the countryside of Campania and Apulia, hoping to pull the southern Italian cities from their alliance with Rome. Despite their many defeats, in 216 the Romans assembled yet another army to face Hannibal at Cannae. Although heavily outnumbered, Hannibal used an elaborate envelopment maneuver to annihilate yet another Roman army. An estimated 50,000 Roman soldiers were killed, and the whole of southern Italy went into revolt against the Romans.[PARAGRAPH:2]After this disaster, the Romans adopted a Fabian strategy (named after their commander Quintus Fabius Maximus) of avoiding battle with Hannibal and striking at his supplies. Despite receiving no assistance from Carthage, Hannibal continued to campaign across Italy holding together his ragtag army together in enemy territory for a decade. After his brothers Hasdrubal (207 BC) and Mago (205 - 203 BC) failed to relieve his army, however, any hope of successfully conquering Rome was lost.[PARAGRAPH:2]Meanwhile, the Roman general Publius Cornelius Scipio had completed the Roman conquest of Hispania and invaded northern Africa. The Carthaginian government recalled Hannibal to Africa, where he was charged with defending the Carthage with untrained new levies. This was an all but impossible task, and after Hannibal's elephants failed to break the Roman lines at the Battle of Zama (202 BC), his infantry was routed and he had no choice but to surrender.[PARAGRAPH:2]The Roman victory put an end to the war. Hannibal returned to Carthage, and was elected to be a "soffet," or one of the chief magistrates of the city-state. He was so effective in reorganizing the government that Carthage was able to pay back the heavy tribute Rome demanded earlier than expected and without exceptional taxation. Alarmed at this development and fearing Carthage's resurgence, the Roman Senate forced Hannibal into exile; he found refuge at the court of Antiochus III of the Seleucid Empire until the Romans demanded that he be surrendered to them. Rather than be given over to his enemies, Hannibal committed suicide in 183 BC.[PARAGRAPH:2]Although Hannibal's campaigns have been endlessly studied by military historians, we know very little about the man himself. All of the surviving accounts of the Second Punic War were written by the Romans, who detested Hannibal and had nothing complimentary to say about him (Hannibal's name was literally used as a bogeyman to scare misbehaving Roman children). Reading between the lines of their accounts, however, it is clear that Hannibal treated his foes with respect and was greatly admired by his soldiers.[PARAGRAPH:2]Hannibal proved himself to be a fine political as well as military leader, a distinction that few men in history can claim. His success in defeating much larger Roman armies time and time again while operating in enemy country unquestionably ranks him as one of the greatest military commanders of all time.</English>

		<Chinese>[H1]汉尼拔·巴尔卡[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]生卒年份：[\BOLD]前247-前183年[PARAGRAPH:2:1][BOLD]背景：[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]历数世界军事史的诸多伟大统帅，没有一位能与汉尼拔·巴尔卡相提并论。他是哈米尔卡·巴尔卡的儿子，生于公元前247年，之后不久迦太基在第一次布匿战争中战败。哈米尔卡期望他将征服伊比利亚半岛作为自己的使命，以此弥补在战争中被迫割让西西里给罗马的损失。汉尼拔长大后，他加入了父亲的军队并且掌握了指挥作战的艺术。传说，汉尼拔曾立誓终生与罗马为敌。[PARAGRAPH:2:1]公元前221年,他的父亲和姐夫死后，汉尼拔被拥戴为伊比利亚半岛的迦太基军队最高统帅。他花了两年时间平息了当地的叛乱，并于公元前219年向萨贡托城发动了进攻。汉尼拔意在挑起一场大战：这座城市处于罗马的保护之下，他的进攻无疑是想要引发一起外交危机。事实上，局势很快恶化，罗马决定向迦太基宣战，第二次布匿战争爆发了。[PARAGRAPH:2:1]获悉战争爆发的消息后，汉尼拔立刻决定着手准备一个突袭意大利半岛的大胆计划。他召集了最可靠的非洲及伊比利亚士兵开始向东进军。公元前218年，越过比利牛斯山脉并巧妙绕过南高卢的一支罗马军团后，汉尼拔率领部队勇敢翻越了阿尔卑斯山脉，这一壮举当时无人能够想象，罗马举国上下为之震惊。[PARAGRAPH:2:1]当他出现在山脉另一边时，汉尼拔获得了波河流域高卢部落的支持。这些新盟友的军事援助使在艰难的翻越山脉过程中损兵折将的汉尼拔恢复了元气，他在特拉比亚河畔向一支罗马军团发动进攻，通过侧翼包抄战术一举将其击溃。在这之后的公元前217年，汉尼拔翻越亚平宁山脉，目标直指意大利中部，他在特拉西梅诺湖畔歼灭了罗马主力军团。现在整个意大利都没有力量能与之抗衡。[PARAGRAPH:2:1]通往罗马的道路正向他敞开，但汉尼拔缺乏攻城武器，他很清楚他没有机会攻占这座城市。因此他转而攻入意大利南部并洗劫了坎帕尼亚和阿普里亚地区的乡村，企图把南意大利各城邦都纳入对抗罗马的同盟。公元前216年，尽管经历了一系列失败，罗马人仍然集合了另一支大军在坎尼与汉尼拔对阵。汉尼拔的军队在数量上处于绝对下风，但他依靠计划周密的机动战术包围歼灭了这支罗马军队。据说此役五万罗马士兵战死，整个南意大利陷入叛乱。[PARAGRAPH:2:1]这场灾难之后，罗马开始采取费边战术——即避免与汉尼拔决战而是骚扰他的补给线（由罗马军队的新统师昆图斯·费边·马克西姆斯的名字命名）。尽管无法从迦太基本土获得任何援助，汉尼拔仍然率领其成份庞杂的部队在意大利这个敌国领土上转战了十年。他的弟弟哈斯德鲁巴尔（公元前207年）和马戈（公元前205至203年）的两次驰援行动失败后，征服罗马的希望终于完全破灭。 [PARAGRAPH:2:1]与此同时，罗马将军格奈乌斯·科尔内利乌斯·西庇阿完成了对伊比利亚的征服并开始入侵北非。迦太基元老院迅速把汉尼拔召回非洲，他被受命用未经训练的新兵保卫迦太基本土。这几乎是不可能完成的任务，在公元前202年的扎马之战中，汉尼拔用战象冲破罗马军团阵线的尝试失败后，他的步兵被击溃了，他别无选择，只得投降。[PARAGRAPH:2:1]罗马人依靠这次胜利结束了这场战争。汉尼拔回到迦太基当选为行政官，即城邦的最高文职长官。他立刻重组政府并维持其高效运作，在没有开征额外税收的情况下提前付清了罗马严苛的战争赔款。迦太基的迅速恢复使得罗马害怕这个国家会重新崛起，罗马元老院迫使迦太基流放汉尼拔，他在塞琉古王朝安条克三世的宫廷里得到了庇护，直到罗马要求将其引渡回国受审。公元前183年，决不愿向敌人投降的汉尼拔选择了自杀。[PARAGRAPH:2:1]尽管汉尼拔的诸多战役被后代的军事学家反复研究，但对于他个人我们知之甚少。所有关于第二次布匿战争的残存资料都是罗马人记载的，他们憎恶汉尼拔并吝于给他任何赞美的言辞（汉尼拔这个名字曾被用于吓唬顽劣的罗马儿童）。但从这些记载的字里行间可以发现汉尼拔博得了对手的尊敬，更获得了其部下的极大爱戴。[PARAGRAPH:2:1]作为一个军事领袖的同时，汉尼拔证明自己同样是个优秀的行政官员，史上少有人能与之比肩。他在敌国境内一次又一次地击败数量处于极大优势的罗马军团，这样的战绩使他能够毫无争议地位列有史以来最伟大的军事统帅名单之中。[PARAGRAPH:2:1]</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]Though laws and systems vary, as property, slaves may be bought and sold. Slaves can be held from the time of their capture, purchase or birth, and deprived of the right to leave, to refuse to work, or to demand compensation. Historically, slavery was institutionally recognized by most societies; in more recent times, slavery has been outlawed in all countries, but it continues through the practices of debt bondage, serfdom, domestic servants kept in captivity, certain adoptions in which children are forced to work as slaves, child soldiers, and forced marriage. Slavery is officially illegal in all countries, but there are still an estimated 20 million to 36 million slaves worldwide. Mauritania was the last jurisdiction to officially outlaw slavery (in 1981/2007), but about 10% to 20% of its population is estimated to live in slavery.[PARAGRAPH:1]Slavery has existed before written history and has existed in many cultures. Most slaves today are debt slaves, largely in South Asia, who are under debt bondage incurred by lenders, sometimes even for generations. Human trafficking is primarily used for forcing women and children into sex industries.</English>

		<Chinese>[标签]虽然法律和制度各不相同，但作为财产，奴隶可以买卖。奴隶可以从被俘虏、购买或出生之时起被关押，并被剥夺离开、拒绝工作或要求赔偿的权利。历史上，奴隶制在制度上为大多数社会所承认；最近一段时间，奴隶制在所有国家都被宣布为非法，但它继续通过债役、农奴制、被囚禁的家庭佣人、强迫儿童充当奴隶、儿童兵和强迫婚姻的某些收养方式。奴隶制在所有国家都是非法的，但据估计全世界仍有2000万至3600万奴隶。毛里塔尼亚是最后一个正式宣布奴隶制的司法管辖区（1981/2007），但大约有10%到20%的人口居住在奴隶制中。[段：1 ]奴隶制在书写历史之前就已经存在，并且存在于许多文化中。如今，大多数奴隶都是债务奴隶，主要是在南亚，他们受到放贷者的债务束缚，有时甚至是几代人。人口贩运主要用于强迫妇女和儿童进入色情行业。</Chinese>

		<English>[TAB]Hollywood is a neighborhood in Los Angeles, California. Hollywood is also the center of the American film industry, making it perhaps the most potent center of cultural influence seen since Paris dominated the world of fashion, arts, and literature in the 18th and 19th centuries. Hollywood owes its existence to two important features: first, the weather is mild and pleasant for most of the year; and second, because of its distance from New Jersey.[PARAGRAPH:1]New Jersey was the first film center in the United States, owing to the simple fact that Thomas Edison lived in New Jersey and he held many patents regarding the new technology. He and other early film producers formed a powerful monopoly on the East Coast, where they spent much time and effort trying to stamp out the many small independent producers. To evade Edison and his lawyers, a number of these businesses relocated to Hollywood, Los Angeles, where they were to shortly put Edison and his cronies out of business.[PARAGRAPH:1]The period of 1927 to 1948 was the "Golden Age of Hollywood." Five major studios dominated the industry. The studios created the "star system," in which they heavily promoted their actors and actresses, making them household names while keeping them in ironclad contracts. The system was eventually broken when the actors began refusing to sign the contracts and instead created their own production companies. During this period Hollywood produced hundreds of movies, some-of which were great, many more of which were mediocre or worse.[PARAGRAPH:1]While Hollywood has diminished somewhat in power and influence, it is still home to many of the major motion picture and television production companies, and it still remains a strong exporter of American culture the world wide.</English>

		<Chinese>好莱坞是加利福尼亚州洛杉矶市的一个社区，也是美国电影工业的中心。这使其成为几乎最强有力的文化中心，正如巴黎在18世纪和19世纪牢牢地统治着世界的时尚，艺术和文学潮流。好莱坞的成功应归功于两个重要因素：首先，全年的大部分时候气候都温和宜人，其次，因为这里远离新泽西。[PARAGRAPH:2]新泽西是美国的第一个电影工业中心，这只是因为托马斯&#12539;爱迪生住在新泽西，他拥有许多与这项新科技有关的专利。他和其他早期电影制片商在东海岸形成了强大的垄断集团，他们花费了大量的时间和精力来压制那些中小的独立制片商。为了躲避爱迪生和他的律师们，这些商人们选择了洛杉矶的好莱坞，在那里他们很快摆脱了爱迪生和他的那些亲信们。[PARAGRAPH:2]1927到1948年是好莱坞的黄金时期。五大主要制片商控制了这一产业。他们创立了明星体制，大力地提拔他们的男女演员，使他们家喻户晓，同时又用合同牢牢地控制着他们。这一制度最终被演员们打破，他们拒绝签这种合同，代以成立自己的制作公司。这一时期好莱坞制作了成百上千的电影，有些是伟大的杰作，但更多的只是平庸或更糟的作品。[PARAGRAPH:2]尽管好莱坞的影响力和权利在某种程度上已经削弱，它仍然是许多大电影制片商和电视出品公司的根据地，它仍然是向全世界出口美国文化的强大力量。</Chinese>
