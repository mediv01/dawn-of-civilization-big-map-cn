RFC Dawn of Civilization Version 1.0
by Leoreth (civfanatics.com)

This is a modmod for Rhye's and Fall of Civilization.

I. Motivation for this mod

For me, RFC is the best mod I've ever experienced. It combines the near perfect gameplay of Civilization 4 with historical accuracy, catering to both the gaming and history fan in me. Still, nothing is perfect, and over the time, I've noticed enough minor things I'd like to change to put them into an own modmod. Most of them were not the fault of the mod itself, but rather things that were carried over from Civilization, where they worked fine, but didn't make much sense in RFC, where there's more emphasis on historical accuracy. I also included ideas from forum discussions and most of all, other mods. There were many things done by others that I liked, and so I "borrowed" and incorporated them. This was not done as a cheap way to get additional features, but rather to include everything I thought was interesting and fun. I hope you share my opinion :)

Keep in mind, however, that I'm the only one who's already tested this modmod on errors and balance. So please don't expect everything to be finished, but rather help me in detecting problems, so that I can create another, better version :)

II. Features of this mod

II.1. General changes

# I included Panopticon's Protestantism mod into DoC, thereby replacing Judaism with Protestantism and renaming Christianity to Catholicism. This was done to increase diplomatic tensions in Europe and to offer a religion more widespread and influential than Judaism, which often spreads unhistorically in RFC, while still being neglegible to the game. Protestantism is founded by the first catholic civilization discovering Printing Press. This triggers an event where the player has to decide whether he wants to embrace the Reformation (and become Protestant) or stay Catholic. AI controlled civs make the same decision randomly, with propabilities varying between civs (Spain is more likely to stay catholic than Netherlands). The founding civs doesn't need to convert, but receives the Holy City in any case. The Protestant Shrine is All Saints' Church in Wittenberg, Germany, where Martin Luther started the Protestant Reformation.
# Inspired by Corossol's modmod RFCC, I also replaced Confucianism with Zoroastrianism. Zoroastrianism is founded by discovering Monarchy, which means that in most of the times, Zoroastrianism is founded by Persia since it spawns with Monarchy. Replacing a Chinese religion was an easy decision, as the impact of a second religion on China is rather low, considering gameplay. Zoroastrianism was included because of its historical significance as monotheistic/henotheistic religion, as well as for gameplay purposes, as it gives the Middle East a religion prior to Islam (now that Judaism is removed) and prohibits a Hinduist Persia, which is very ahistorical. The Zoroastrian shrine, Adur Farnbag, also serves as a replacement shrine for the Persian and Arabian UHV, now that Salomon's Temple doesn't exist anymore. I also found Corossol's idea to represent Confucianism with China's UB, the Confucianist Academy, very elegant, so I also went with it and let Taoism stay.
# The complete civic system is redesigned. Look into the civic changes section for more details.
# Plague was deactivated to help the AI
# Complete dynamic civ names are shown in the main window.

II.2. Civilization changes

# Another inspiration that comes from RFCC is to replace Carthage with the Phoenicians, spawning in Sur in 1200 BC. The main reason is Carthage's history as Phoenicia's colony. I adopted Corossol's UU, the Bireme (a galley that can cross enemy territory and gets +25% against other ancient naval units), but also changed the UB to a Glassmith. This Forge replacement adds an additional trade route at a loss of production bonuses and represents Phoenicia's achievements in the early production of colored glass.
# The Netherlands now spawn in 1500 AD with appropriate techs (including Optics and all requirements for Astronomy). This is the earliest time that's historically possible, since there was no independent Dutch state until the 16th century. Their late spawn also helps the gameplay of medieval Europe because of reduced messiness. Unhistorical, but common occurances such as Dutch Groningen in Jutland are now impossible, as Germany now tends to settle Hamburg or Kiel.
# The Vikings now spawn at Oslo instead of Nidaros/Trondheim. This was to make them more involved into European politics (not sure if that worked), and to help them with city placement, especially in southern Scandinavia. And there really is a Stockholm, Kalmar or Göteborg more often (still no Viking Copenhagen, though).
# The Viking dynamic civilization names now change to Sweden after entering the Renaissance.

II.3. Unit changes

# The German unique unit, the Panzer, now requires Oil again, so it is not available ridiculously early. The Commando skill is replaced with Mobility, a less powerful, but also adequate representation of the German Blitzkrieg.
# The Musketeer was removed from the game, as it was nearly useless. The new French unique unit is the Culverin, a Cannon replacement with +25% strength against gunpowder and siege units, showing France's proficiency with Artillery.
# The Arabian unique unit, the Camel Archer, now has +25% against other cavalry, to make them more useful and show how their smell terrified horses.
# The Greek unique unit, the Phalanx, was renamed Hoplite, the proper term for a Greek soldier. Phalanx only refers to their formation.
# The Viking unique unit, the Berserker, was renamed Huscarl, the Viking term for a sworn warrior or knight. While Berserkers did exist, they played only a minor role in Viking warfare.
# The Ethiopian unique unit, the Oromo Warrior, was renamed Askari, an Arabic term for soldier. The Oromo were actually enemies of the Ethiopians, so their name doesn't really fit.

II.4. Building changes

# Monument was renamed Pagan Temple to represent the adherence of paganic religions. It can add a normal religion's temple's happiness when under the "Pantheon" civic. They now expire with Divine Right.
# Germany's Assembly Plant now adds a free engineer instead of additional engineer slots.
# China's Pavillion was removed from the game. Their new UB is a Confucian Academy, a University available with Paper, giving +20% research, +1 happiness and a priest slot.
# France's Salon is now a Theatre instead of a Observatory and adds +20% great person birth as a bonus.
# The Viking Trading Post now also offers a merchant slot.
# Persia's Apothecary is now called Bazaar and replaces a Market, thus already available with Currency.

II.5. Wonder changes

# The Leaning Tower was replaced with the name and graphics of the Pantheon.
# Stonehenge was replaced with the name and graphics of the Great Sphinx of Giza.
# Moai Statue were replaced with the name and graphics of the Great Cothon of Carthage.
# The Islamic Shrine, Masjid al-Haram, now has appropriate Graphics and Button, instead of those of the Dome of the Rock.
# Religiously associated wonders now require their respective religion in a city to be built. This was done to decrease historically incorrect wonder locations.
# Catholic wonders: Hagia Sophia, Sistine Chapel, Apostolic Palace, Notre Dame, Cristo Redentor
# Muslim wonders: University of Sankore, Spiral Minaret
# Buddhist wonders: Shwedagon Paya, Wat Preah Pisnulok
# Hinduist wonders: Taj Mahal (while I'm aware that the Taj Mahal was built by the Muslim Mughal Empire, making its requirement Islam would result in it being built in the Middle East instead of in India)
# Wonders associated with the Ancient Mediterranean, the Seven World Wonders in particular, now require Marble to be built. Along with this, the marble in Southern China was changed to Stone, so that those wonders are built by Greece, Rome, Egypt, Phoenicia or Babylonia. These include: Parthenon, Oracle, Colossus, Mausoleum, Statue of Zeus, Temple of Artemis, Great Library, Great Lighthouse, Great Cothon, Pantheon, Pyramids, Sphinx, Hanging Gardens.

II.6. Leaderhead changes

# RFC's leaderhead switches give us a great possibility to represent different eras and behaviours of Civilizations with different leaderheads. But Civ4's original leaderheads don't always allow this variety. Especially European civs miss proper medieval leaderheads, and I always found it doesn't feel very "Middle Ages" to talk to Elizabeth, Louis XIV and Peter in 1000 AD. So with the help of Panopticons switch code for four leaders, I expanded the leaderheads available for many civs with Graphics designed on civfanatics.com. These include:
# Egypt: added Cleopatra (represented by Hatshepsut) to represent Hellenic Egypt. Thus: Ramesses -> Cleopatra
# Babylonia: renamed Gilgamesh to Sargon of Akkad.
# India: added Akbar (personality: Kublai Khan) to represent Moghul India. Thus: Asoka -> Akbar -> Gandhi
# Phoenicia: added Elishat (Dido, personality: Catherine) to represent early Phoenicia. Thus: Elishat -> Hannibal
# Japan: added Jimmu (personality: Pericles) for an early, more trade-friendly Japan and Meiji for a more tech-oriented, expansionist Japan. Thus: Jimmu -> Tokugawa -> Meiji
# Ethiopia: added Haile Selassie (personality: Asoka) to represent modern Ethiopia. Thus: Zara Yaqob -> Haile Selassie
# Arabia: added Abu Bakr (personality: Shaka) to represent expansionist Arabia. Thus: Abu Bakr -> Saladin
# Vikings: added Gustav Adolph to represent Sweden. Thus: Ragnar -> Gustav Adolph
# Spain: added Philip II (personality: Mehmed) to represent colonial Spain. Thus: Isabella -> Philip II
# France: moved Charlemagne from Germany to France to represent medieval France. Thus: Charlemagne -> Louis XIV -> Napoleon -> de Gaulle
# England: added Alfred the Great (represented by Brennus) to represent medieval England. Thus: Alfred -> Elizabeth -> Victoria -> Churchill
# Germany: added Charles V (personality Charlemagne) to represent medieval/renaissance Germany. Thus: Charles V -> Frederick -> Bismarck
# Russia: added Ivan IV (personality: Alexander) to represent medieval Russia. Thus: Ivan IV -> Peter -> Catherine -> Stalin
# Portugal: added Afonso Henriques to represent medieval Portugal. Thus: Afonso -> Joao
# Turkey: added Mustafa Kemal Atatürk to represent modern Turkey. Thus: Mehmed -> Suleiman -> Atatürk

II.7. Graphic changes

# The Chinese have a light yellow color now (Zulu colors from BtS), the traditional Ming color.
# Germany now has the color and coat of arms of Holy Rome, as they have been symbols for Germany much longer than the Prussian iron cross.
# The Arabian coat of arms was changed from the palm tree back to the shahada symbol from Civilization.
# The English secondary color was changed from white to yellow, so that their coat of arms now shows the historical golden lions on red.
# The Byzantine color was changed to dark purple (Rome in Civ, Carthage in RFC), to make them more distinguishable from Independents.
# The Phoenician primary color was lightened up as a consequence, now using the color of Sumeria in Civ. Their secondary color is still yellow.

II.8. Civic changes

# The civic system was completely redesigned, save Rhye's expansion category, which exists outside of the rest and works fine. However, many effects of the standard system still exist and only have been recombined or moved between categories. The main problems of Civ's civics was:
	1. Often, civics in one category were not mutually exclusive. Law was a major offender here, as a society could very well run in Nationhood, be governed by a Bureaucracy and still have Free Speech.
	2. Civics that support a certain type of economy (cottage economy, specialist economy) were not thematically fitting. I tried to stick to the concept Capitalism = CE, Communism = SE, Fascism = war economy.
# The new five civic categories are: Government, Organization, Society, Economy, Religion
# Government:
	1. Tyranny (standard)
	2. Monarchy (Monarchy): +1 happiness per military unit
	3. Theocracy (Theology): +3 experience in cities with state religion
	4. Autocracy (Nationalism): +2 happiness with barracks, can draft military units
	5. Republic (Philosophy): unlimited Artist, Scientist, Merchant. +100% cottage growth
# Organization:
	1. Direct Rule (standard)
	2. Vassalage (Feudalism): +2 experience per military unit
	3. Absolutism (Civil Service): +33% production and commerce in the capital
	4. Representation (Constitution): +3 research per specialist, +2 happiness in biggest cities, -50% maintenance from distance to capital
	5. Parliamentarism (Democracy): +1 hammers in towns, +1 free specialist
# Society:
	1. Tribalism (standard)
	2. Aristocracy (Monarchy): Lower unit maintenance, +50% great general emergence
	3. Socialism (Communism): unlimited Engineers, +100% culture, +100% great people birth, +25% number of cities maintenance
	4. Totalitarianism (Fascism): +25% military unit production, -50% war weariness
	5. Capitalism (Liberalism): +2 commerce in towns, can spend gold to finish production
# Economy:
	1. Self-sufficiency (standard)
	2. Serfdom (Masonry): can sacrifice population to finish production
	3. Mercantilism (Banking): +1 free specialist, +1 commerce in cottage, workshop, no foreign trade routes
	4. State Property(Communism): +10% production, +1 food and hammer in workshop, watermill, no number of cities maintenance
	5. Free Market (Economics): +1 trade routes, +50% trade route yield
# Religion:
	1. Animism (standard)
	2. Pantheon (Polytheism): +1 happiness for monument, no state religion
	3. Patriarchate (Monotheism): +25% building production with state religion, missionaries without monasteries
	4. State Church (Divine Right): +25% unit production with state religion, +1 happiness with state religion, no foreign religion spread
	5. Secularism (Liberalism): +10% research, +1 happiness per religion

II.8 Map changes

# Prohibited Inverness from unrealistical growth. One fish changed to whale, another moved south to only be accessible by Edinburgh. Replaced Inbhir Nis with Dun Eiheann (Edinburgh)
# Removed many peaks and made them hills instead. Affected areas are China, Spain, Turkey, Bohemia, Cuba. Cyprus is now a copper hill.
# Moved several ressources to make certain city locations more appealing, including Hamburg and Oslo (moved pigs) or Barcelona (moved clam).
# There are now gems in Namibia and Afghanistan (lapis lazuli).
# Added an ivory ressource 2S of Carthage and a wheat ressource near Tripolis, to make Northern Africa more useful.
# Changed Chinese marble to stone to stop them from building mediterranean wonders.
# Added many improvements for the Byzantines in the 600 AD start.

III. Further development

III.1. Known issues

The problems mentioned here are known and will be fixed at a given time.
# There are many civilopedia entries and translations missing (especially in Spanish, French, Italian).
# Protestant buildings and missionaries still look Jewish.
# The Chinese UHV technically requires them to build two Taoist and Zoroastrian shrines now.
# The Dutch UHV needs more time for its exploration condition (or a replacement).
# The Phoenician UHV is easy to win as they start next to two dye.

III.2. To be tested

# The religion changes affect the UHVs of Ethiopia, India, China, Persia and Arabia. Test the change of difficulty.
# See how Netherlands do with their late spawn, colonization shows mixed results so far.
# Overall game evolution testing by creating America starts.

III.3. Future features

Everything I'd like to include in the future:
# UP of Indirect Rule for England: less colony costs.
# More useful UP for Japan: faster experience like with the charismatic trait, maybe.
# Replace boring/unchallenging UHV conditions (no foreign culture, circumnavigation).
# Inclusion of more wonders, especially Arabian/medieval ones, including: La Mezquita, Gardens of Al Andalus, Theodosian Walls, Terracotta Army, Ishtar Gate, Brandenburg Gate, San Marco Basilica, Temple of Salomon, Krak des Chevaliers
# Redesign of Corporations
# Byzantines instead of Maya in the 3000 BC scenario, playable Byzantines and Prussia instead of Maya in the 600 AD scenario.
# ...
