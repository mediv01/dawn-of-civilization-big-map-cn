GAME RULES
* Units are moved to a nearby tile when an independent city spawns
* Wonders only grant free buildings to cities in a valid building location
* Non-state religions cause unhappiness
* Civs with state religion dislike civs without a state religion as if they had a different religion
* When upgraded, units lose all their promotions and regain the expended experience
