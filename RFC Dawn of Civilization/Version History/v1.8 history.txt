GAME MECHANICS
# added a routine that removes Christianity from Anatolia when Byzantium collapses
# added a Mongol horde event that spawns armies for AI Mongolia at the Russian, Persian and Seljuk borders
# scripted spread of Islam to Indonesia around 1500 AD
# religion spread turns pagan temples into temples of the new religion *
# pagan temples can't be built in cities with religions *
# resurrected civs get predertemined capitals
# resurrection can only happen to civs in historical intervals *
# Nationalism is not necessary for resurrections, but increases their likeliness *
# "free tech" events like the Oracle or Liberalism only allow you to choose techs from your current era or earlier *
# relocated war maps into the DLL, they now also influence which cities the AI attacks
# protected Middle Eastern cities from getting razed by Seljuks and Mongols
# culture level of independent or minor civs is limited to 2
# as long as you own no cities, you can enter enemy territory and found cities there (AI only)
# great people names now appear in semi-chronological order (there's still some randomness involved, but modern names won't appear early anymore)
# the AI can't win the game during autoplay anymore
# Seljuk and independent cities immediately flip to Turkey to offset their lack of starting settlers
# former city garrisons get pushed out before they flip to certain civs (Italy, Turkey) to prevent them from becoming too strong
# building a Trading Company as Portugal, Spain, France, England, Netherlands gives you the option to acquire Asian cities in your civs historical area by force or gold *
# vassals can keep control of the first ring around its cities, unless the tile is also part of a the first ring of a master's city
